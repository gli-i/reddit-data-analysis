Customer Success Managers are there because these big complicated enterprise tech companies were constantly getting reviewed on too high a price for features not being used, or the tools are too complicated to implement.

There is plenty of blame on all sides to go around for this. We could look at companies who buy \"best of breed\" and target only a fraction of what makes that best of breed, then because of all these best of breed tools, they don't spend the extra time trying to integrate into other tools so instead, technical debt skyrockets. 

Then you have technical folks who approach it from a perspective of what makes my life easier, but don't consider the impact on other technical or business teams. 

You'll occasionally have higher level leaders who will come in and say you have to use this software because of a relationship, so you have a technical team who didn't like being forced to adopt something, so they give it the minimum effort to implement. 

Then you have business users who force a system without IT's input because well, they don't trust IT. IT to them is like a utility.

t3_1ecp4m6,"Something I would put forward to push against the “bullshit jobs” narrative *for some* of this as a project manager, which is famously a bullshit job.

Scale. When you get to big companies, the scale of just “stuff” that ultimately does have to be done that “seems simple and fast” adds up to an unbelievable amount.

For instance you get a new project. You look over the contract, the scope, the timeline. Depending on complexity, your internal systems, and your institutional power as a PM (ie do you set the timeline and build a custom one? Is it organizationally or sales prescribed and you fit your resources to it? Etc etc) 

A lot of this can be done quickly, maybe a couple hours. But now multiple that my 11 active projects of varied complexity that just came in? Okay, well that’s almost a week of work *just to setup the projects administratively*. 

Now you have to get them going. You have to pull in resources and talk to them for a few hours about each project and make sure each team is on the same page since they all have different workstreams that don’t cross each other. Okay there’s *another working week of hours or more just to meet internally about getting the projects going”

Now you have to get it going with the customer. Same story

Now you have to be doing that while making sure current running projects are staying on task, in scope, in budget, and aligned internally and externally. *because at this scale and number of projects and specificity of workstreams, you can’t fairly expect the SME’s to be able to do this too*

Scale changes everything. So while there are absolutely bullshit jobs, the reality is when doing tons of stuff, there is “stuff” that needs to be done that can’t just be added on to other people’s plate that actually “do the real stuff” but that other stuff *still has to happen* just to make sure the real stuff happens. When the world moved slower, there was just so much less stuff and work expectations were more reasonable so the people that did the real stuff could do the adjacent stuff. But now there is so much adjacent stuff that now there actually does need to be jobs that are only about adjacent stuff just to keep the real stuff people’s heads above water",10,0.923

The salesman helps make them feel that is being done, without the unnecessary fluff of, \"well this widget it better than that widget, but this third widget might be better for you\".

As far as \"middle man\" jobs. I am not sure about your area, but at least in mine, there is a large gap between the C-Suite and pretty much anyone else anymore. \"middle men\" really exist in name only.

The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

t3_1ecp4m6,"Have you ever heard the phrase “time is money”. In your example, you could cut out the PM and work directly with the Project Sponsor but that would take a lot of time away from them. In my experience, Project Sponsors are director-level or above individuals who have an entirely separate job aside from whatever project you’re working on, and there may be multiple projects they’re sponsoring. 

If you take a Sales Director who is sponsoring a Salesforce implementation, they don’t stop being a Sales Director to focus on your project. They still have to manage sales territories, go on client calls, participate in the hiring process, etc…and the time they spend on your project is taking money away from themselves and the company. 

With that in mind, the argument for middlemen jobs is easy, take my example, if the Sales Director focuses heavily on your project he could theoretically lose about $200,000 because he wasn’t able to attend a client call or help close a sale (mind that loss is essentially solidified when the project was approved). So, if you could hire a person to handle the project for $100,000, then you’re essentially saving $100,000.

The other thing to consider is if a company has several projects going on. Let’s say there are 3 projects concurrently underway, each with the same cost, hiring a PM would then save $500,000.

The logic is easy to understand when you look at everything from a “time spent” perspective. A good middleman (such as a PM) that uses their time efficiently and is proactive can be worth their weight in gold. Unfortunately, most times we have to settle for bronze, at best.",1,0.9666

I work for a big global tech org that has so many different possible tech solutions to offer that no one, no matter how technical, understands everything in every area.  The various middlemen, when they're doing their job well, help to keep big complicated projects on track and simplify what's happening so that business people can understand it.  When they're not doing their job well is when they're useless middlemen.

Sales make connections with individual customers and decision makers, find out what they need, put together a list of things we can actually deliver, and convince them to put signatures on contracts.  If they suck, they sell the customer on everything they can, not carrying whether it will help them or we can actually deliver it, and walk away once they get their commission.

Sales Engineers/Architects take that list of things the customer is going to buy and work out the high level technical details of how we'll actually deliver that in their specific environment.  If they suck, they're just handing back cookie cutter architecture plans without any concern about the customer's specific needs and complications.

Project Managers put project teams together and keep them working on track to make delivery deadlines.  They also communicate statuses and problems to customers and managers and help bring in people who are needed to overcome any problems that come up. If they suck they just take notes and email meeting minutes, don't understand anything about what's going on, and hassle people to deliver to impossible deadlines without doing anything to remove roadblocks.

Account Managers or Customer (whatever) Managers act as liaisons with the customer *after* their service is live, keeping them happy and advocating for them whenever problems happen.  Their primary job is to make sure the customer wants to renew once their initial contact is over.

The issue isn't the 120v/0.5A desk fan. The issue is the under sized service and the overloading of the circuit breaker at the panel. I bet the white conductors in the panel are dark, which could lead to a fire. 

Another thing is that all those motors are what we call inductive loads they do something really funky to the sine wave add in desk computer, laptops, certain lights, phone chargers, TVs, small cooking appliances etc and you now have a load issue. 

Lastly, a short circuit could only happen in your case by the motor windings touching the case or each other(windings) or the hot and neutral (blk and white) touching each other.

Think of it another way, If you could hire 5 people to do your job and your average amount of work went from 40 hours to 2-3 hours a week should you still get paid the same? No, because you are no longer providing value to the company. You would get canned and your 5 employees would have to pick up the \"work\" you do.

If CEOs for big companies were making between $500,000-$1,000,000 a year and workers were paid properly, not near minimum wage, then I don’t believe the animosity towards CEOs would exist, as they are earning a higher wage that is fairly proportional to their role. Instead these same CEOs are making 50-100X that, workers are not paid fairly for the fruits of their labor, and we have a giant divide between the rich “owning” class and the working class. 

The aspect of the “CEOs doing nothing” just compounds upon this fundamental issue, because if a factory worker is busting their ass daily and they can’t even pay their bills what are they going to think if they see the CEO doing nothing making more in a day than he will in a year?

There's the \"moral\" perspective of \"CEO's shouldn't make 50x or 100x what their employees do, because it's not fair or equitable and the employees deserve better.\"

Unfortunately, this isn't how the economy works. Your compensation is based purely on what the market dictates. There are very few people who have the experience and skillset to run a corporation. Alternatively, there are millions of people who can perform the daily tasks that corporation needs to function. As a result, the market enables folks with the skillset to run the operation to make a tremendous amount of money because they know they have all of the leverage. The corporation needs both of these assets to survive, but one is much more easily replaceable than the other.

    These assholes scheduled her on a Wednesday and while the owner is on vacation fired her without warning or notice when she didn’t show up. She only knew she was scheduled that day because she checked the schedule for the next day and saw she was supposed to work. Nobody called her to ask where she was or to tell her she missed a shift, and now she’s just deleted from the schedule.  


    Bitch ass manager doesn’t like my girlfriend because she’s repeatedly brought up tip share. the waiters tip out 4%(!!!) of sales to bussers, equaling to 20% of tips, even on days where they don’t have bussers. When she brought this up they swore up and down the bussers got all that money on the weekend but when she worked as busser she didn’t receive near as much money as they’re putting in to tipshare.


    She averages like $200 as a server so she’s tipping out $40 every shift when they only have bussers on Saturday and Sunday. So multiple servers are tipping out $40 in a day but when she worked a shift as a busser on a Saturday she made $70 off tip share.

Second one is stupid human nature. Why do you think so many people are xenophobes, racists and similar? Because this way they can put somebody down and be better than them. Of course it is all in their heads, but that's how it always was.

Kind of like the high stress and sacrifice that comes with joining the military. You don’t go into it without knowing certain basic things that the job requires or expects.

Barista jobs are about fast service to people who need their caffeine fix.

Right or wrong, there are thousands of high stress coffee shops with the expectation that these people need it NOW.

It is entirely okay that this did not work out for you. A slower paced job is out there where you can excel and do what you know how to.

t3_1ecbedc,"Look, I'll be honest, restaurant/cafe work isn't for everyone and its really hard at first. I worked as a Barista for a decade while I was younger. 

For anyone who finds themselves in this situation here's what your boss meant: 

- Left soap on the blades of the blender: its a food safety issue. You can't downplay that - and it can affect the taste of the drinks. Shows that you didn't take care with the task. (Yelling isn't cool though)   
- Cream cheese issue: you needed to ask more questions: how much should I use, can you please be specific for me? Thanks so much etc.   
- Washed something for too long: you were focused on one task and didn't complete it quickly, and didn't show that you were aware of other tasks that needed to be done in the area.   
- Too introverted: shy and not initiating questions/etc. (can be a huge issue if you show respect by following directions, goes a bit in the \"needs to take initiative\" vein which translates to: I have no idea what I want you to do, why can't you figure it out?)   
- Can't multitask: usually in a restaurant that means that you don't do a quick thorough job or you do things hyperfocused when they don't need to be. Nimbleness is handy in these jobs. 

The yelling: is not okay. See my final point. 

If you go for a restaurant job again or a barista job, don't wait to be told things: ask.   
Most of the time your \"training\" will be either being paired up with another employee or someone will try to train you while service is happening. 

You can take Barista courses to learn about all of that before you begin a job, so you're not starting from the beginning. 

You need to be light on your feet, quick to react, and ready to smile in these jobs. 

The MOST important take away though... the ABSOLUTE #1 takeaway for anyone.... if they hire you with no experience and don't train you kindly or well, then you *don't want to work there... trust me!*

You love everything about your job up until this point, you had a bad experience and you're upset how it's been handled, and you're justified in thinking that. 

Here's a few things I think should be considered before you make any decisions:

You may not be CC'd in the email chain. If there's any coaching or correction given to your department head, you probably wouldn't be included in that. You should talk to your supervisors in person and casually ask if anything has come of it. You could say it took the wind out of your sails a bit too try and get them to relax and be more open.

If your department managers superiors are competent, they would have reviewed the policy change long before it was rolled out, and your manager looks like an idiot to them now. 

If your job was done incorrectly then additional costs hurting the bottom line and that's all the VP's care about - business. The customer signed off on it and your name has been attached to your quality work so far (good business). I don't think you need to worry about being judged at work for it, it's easily disproved.

If you're being targeted and repeatedly experiencing things like this you should find a different solution. If this was a one off incident, I would probably give it some time.

\"You can always be an asshole later\" I read somewhere and it stuck with me.

Just know that if you try to handle this based on pride and emotions, it probably won't end in your favor. Always be professional if you're trying to resolve things, or just do your thing.

I've had 8 jobs since I graduated, I've only given notice to 2 of them. Don't take shit and don't miss out on opportunities because of some delusional sense of loyalty to your company or coworkers. Do what's good for you, with a sober mind.

2. Don't undermine the management team.

a) a public apology

b) a private apology with a public message from supervisors correcting the record & confirming the correct procedure

End the e-mail with thanks for his feedback and stating that you always welcome continued suggestions for improvement and increased revenue/savings received in 1-1 meetings, project debriefs, performance reviews, new or updated procedures that evolve to meet changing needs, etc.

Yeah agreed. It’s about as enlightening as “if we remove this penalty, the thing we’re penalizing will happen more.”

Closing schools was absolutely the right choice at the start of the pandemic. Keeping them closed as long as we did was not.

---

In hindsight we learned that COVID didn't pose much of a risk to students and unlike many adults, kids really don't care about masks and changes to the rules. I watched a kid eat applesauce through a mask, then changed masks before running to play on the playground with peers. We could have reopened with mask mandates and active classroom shutdowns a month after the initial shutdowns. 

However if COVID had mutated even slightly differently the story would be completely different. We got lucky that the virus didn't end up going after the young, let's hope we never learn how bad things could have gotten.

The other issue is that covid forced everyone to admit what school is to many families. Expected and mandatory state sponsored day care. Education is honestly the secondary aspect of schools, having a place for kids to be for 9 hours each week day is what allows the modern dual income household to exist. Without that you need someone to be the caretaker and it's unbelievably difficult to produce economic output and be with a child simultaneously. And that assumes you have the privilege to perform a task that can be done through a screen and work for an employer who allows you to work remotely. Watching parents be on a meeting while making sure their kids were on our zoom/teams/meetup/whatever session was amazing, thank you parents for the help during that time.

If there is a future situation where schools need to close this needs to be addressed immediately through additional support to families. All the parents out there went through double hell for longer than we truly needed to. For that, every teacher and educator should be grateful, and hopefully all parents have a better appreciation for what teachers provide. 

Because the other aspect to Education is the teachers, and I know from experience that the solidarity shown by educators to promote safety is greater than anything, even wage increases. If the district had pushed to return to mandatory in person Education before teachers were eligible for vaccines, the reopening wouldn't have happened. Too many teachers and site admin would have quit rather than go back.

From the linked article: 

Strong COVID-19 restrictions likely saved lives in the US and the death toll could have been higher if more states didn’t impose these restrictions, according to US research. The study found that if all US states had imposed restrictions similar to those used in the 10 most restrictive states, excess deaths would have been an estimated 10% to 21% lower over a 2-year period. The research also found that if all states had weak restrictions there would have been an estimated 13% to 17% increase in excess deaths compared to what occurred. The study found that mask requirements and vaccine mandates were linked to lower rates of excess deaths. The researchers say not all restrictions were equally effective; some, such as school closings, likely provided minimal benefit while imposing substantial cost.",26,0.5627

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1,0.7393
t3_1ectdb6,"Academic paper [here.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.124.047643)

“New research led by UCLA Health has found that specific genes may be related to the trajectory of recovery for stroke survivors, providing doctors insights useful for developing targeted therapies.

Published in the journal Stroke this month, the findings were part of an exploratory study that sought to find if candidate genes could predict a higher likelihood of stroke outcomes related to depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive decline.

Dr. Steven C. Cramer, MD, the study’s lead author and a professor of neurology at UCLA, said while there are some predictors physicians can use to anticipate stroke recovery, such as a patient’s age or baseline health, they only tell part of the story.

“In the big picture, the issue that we face is that, when somebody has a stroke, it’s hard to anticipate what’s going to come next,” said Cramer. “People look up to us from the gurney in the ER and say, ‘What’s next? What’s going to happen to me?’ People want to understand what their trajectory will be, people want to have a sense of how well going to be, or not, and what treatments are available to them.”

Similarly, clinicians who treat patients with stroke need improved methods to understand how a patient will fare in order to develop a personalized medicine approach for each individual, Cramer said.

Past studies have provided evidence that genetic differences are related the process of stroke recovery, but there has been limited study on the specific outcomes with which these genes are associated. For example, most previous genetic studies related to stroke have relied on the modified Rankin scale, which is a measure of global disability that combines recovery data across all behaviors into one single-digit score.

However, Cramer said this scoring system does not account for the granular differences in stroke outcomes for patients, such as a patient having improved movement but continued severe depression, or having persistent anxiety but showing good recovering of arm movement. As a result, Dr. Cramer, in collaboration with Dr. E. Alison Holman at UC Irvine, sought to determine whether there was a method to more precisely measure the various behavioral outcomes among stroke survivors.

To do this, Cramer and his team measured details for a group of candidate genes to examine in more than 700 patients enrolled throughout the U.S. Additionally, researchers conducted detailed behavioral assessments of the participants’ cognitive health, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and other deficits for one year after the stroke.

The study found significant associations between certain genes and these behavioral health outcomes. Specifically, the rs6265 gene variant was associated with poorer cognition. This gene variant is related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which is the most common growth factor in the brain and is strongly associated with learning. About 20-30% of people are estimated to have this genetic variant, which slows the release of BDNF.

“Your brain gushes out BDNF when you’re learning new things,” Cramer said. “Hopefully your brain is gushing out BDNF at this very moment. People who have this gene variant had poorer cognitive status at one year.”

Environmental factors, such as stressors, also played a role in genetic expression among stroke patients. Patients with the gene variants rs4291 and rs324420 were at higher risk for developing more severe depression and PTSD symptoms after one-year post-stroke.

“The more stress they reported, the more the gene variant was associated with poorer outcomes,” Cramer said.

Another variant, rs4680 was linked to lower depression and PTSD symptoms.

While the results still require independent verification, Cramer said these insights could help physicians and other allied health professionals tailor treatment options for patients based on a simple genetic test.

“If these discoveries are validated as accurate, you could look at someone on the day they have their stroke and say, ‘I know that on average you are at higher risk of a poorer outcome regarding cognitive function a year from now,’” Cramer said. “Maybe those are the people that need extra cognitive rehab or maybe one day we’ll have a drug that targets certain gene receptors. The idea is that you could divide people into different groups and use that knowledge not just for prediction but hopefully one day for improved, individualized treatment.”",2,-0.9847

t3_1ect3fk,"Academic paper [here.](https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awae153/7714669)

“An experimental drug originally developed to treat cancer may help clear HIV from infected cells in the brain, according to a new Tulane University study.

For the first time, researchers at Tulane National Primate Research Center found that a cancer drug significantly reduced levels of SIV, the nonhuman primate equivalent of HIV, in the brain by targeting and depleting certain immune cells that harbor the virus.

Published in the journal Brain, this discovery marks a significant step toward eliminating HIV from hard-to-reach reservoirs where the virus evades otherwise effective treatment.

“This research is an important step in tackling brain-related issues caused by HIV, which still affect people even when they are on effective HIV medication,” said lead study author Woong-Ki Kim, PhD, associate director for research at Tulane National Primate Research Center. “By specifically targeting the infected cells in the brain, we may be able to clear the virus from these hidden areas, which has been a major challenge in HIV treatment.”

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an essential component of successful HIV treatment, maintaining the virus at undetectable levels in the blood and transforming HIV from a terminal illness into a manageable condition. However, ART does not completely eradicate HIV, necessitating lifelong treatment. The virus persists in “viral reservoirs” in the brain, liver, and lymph nodes, where it remains out of reach of ART.

The brain has been a particularly challenging area for treatment due to the blood-brain barrier — a protective membrane that shields it from harmful substances but also blocks treatments, allowing the virus to persist. In addition, cells in the brain known as macrophages are extremely long-lived, making them difficult to eradicate once they become infected.

Infection of macrophages is thought to contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction, experienced by nearly half of those living with HIV. Eradicating the virus from the brain is critical for comprehensive HIV treatment and could significantly improve the quality of life for those with HIV-related neurocognitive problems.

Researchers focused on macrophages, a type of white blood cell that harbors HIV in the brain. By using a small molecule inhibitor to block a receptor that increases in HIV-infected macrophages, the team successfully reduced the viral load in the brain. This approach essentially cleared the virus from brain tissue, providing a potential new treatment avenue for HIV.

The small molecule inhibitor used, BLZ945, has previously been studied for therapeutic use in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and brain cancer, but never before in the context of clearing HIV from the brain.

The study, which took place at the Tulane National Primate Research Center, utilized three groups to model human HIV infection and treatment: an untreated control group, and two groups treated with either a low or high dose of the small molecule inhibitor for 30 days. The high-dose treatment lead to a notable reduction in cells expressing HIV receptor sites, as well as a 95-99% decrease in viral DNA loads in the brain .

In addition to reducing viral loads, the treatment did not significantly impact microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, which are essential for maintaining a healthy neuroimmune environment. It also did not show signs of liver toxicity at the doses tested.

The next step for the research team is to test this therapy in conjunction with ART to assess its efficacy in a combined treatment approach. This could pave the way for more comprehensive strategies to eradicate HIV from the body entirely.

This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, including grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and was supported with resources from the Tulane National Primate Research Center base grant of the National Institutes of Health, P51 OD011104.”",6,0.3284

t3_1ecovsy,"From the article: When it comes to dating, everyone wants to put their best foot forward. But what if you had to disclose something less flattering? In a study published in [Telematics and Informatics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2024.102159), researchers recently investigated this tricky question, exploring how people manage self-presentation on dates when they have to reveal both negative and positive traits. The findings indicate that women more often disclosed morally disgusting behaviors and artistic abilities, while men tended to reveal pathogenically disgusting behaviors and kindness.

The researchers were motivated by a desire to understand how individuals manage the delicate balance of self-presentation in dating contexts, especially when it involves revealing both positive and negative traits. While extensive research has been conducted on the traits people prefer in potential partners, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding how people choose to disclose their own less desirable qualities. The study aimed to fill this gap by examining which traits individuals prefer to highlight or conceal when trying to make a favorable impression on a date.

Another key motivation was to explore the role of different types of disgust in shaping these self-presentation choices. Disgust, being a fundamental factor influencing social and romantic interactions, can significantly impact one’s image in the eyes of a potential partner. By focusing on three specific types of disgust—pathogen, sexual, and moral—the researchers hoped to uncover patterns in how these different forms of disgust affect dating dynamics.",25,0.93
t3_1ecovsy,"In other words, men treat morality and abilities as a more critical measure of a person, and would judge them more based on that. While women would measure/judge more based on behavior.

The rise of social media has provided individuals with new ways to express humor but also to engage in antisocial behaviors online. A survey in the UK found that 75% of individuals between 13 and 36 years of age shared memes online, while over 25% reported being victims of online trolling.

Memes are pieces of media that are “passed very quickly from one internet user to another, often with slight changes that make them humorous.” One reason for their popularity is their ability to communicate about controversial and taboo topics humorously, typically by individuals who are not affected by the topic.

Online trolling is another behavior that has caught the attention of researchers. Trolling involves behaving in a deceptive or disruptive manner on the internet with no apparent instrumental purpose.

t3_1ecjpcj,"A new study published in Neuropsychology Review has revealed that children and adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit significantly poorer object recognition memory compared to their peers without ADHD. This meta-analysis of 28 studies sheds light on the cognitive challenges faced by this population.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. Children with ADHD often struggle with maintaining focus, following through on tasks, and controlling their impulses. These symptoms can significantly impact academic performance, social interactions, and daily activities. ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders in children, but it also affects adults.

Object recognition memory refers to the ability to recognize previously encountered objects and distinguish them from new ones. This type of memory is an important component of declarative memory, which encompasses facts and events that can be consciously recalled. Object recognition memory involves two primary processes: familiarity discrimination, which allows one to recognize something as familiar, and recollection, which involves retrieving details about the encounter

I think this could have to do with both excess attention on too many things sort of chaotically all over the place rather than specifically on the simpler path it is expected by others to be on. As people with ADHD just fundamentally don’t have static attention, it is often difficult to see the basics of what is simply in your vision when your brain is feeding you tons of overwhelm and distracting information in your mind or you are seeing everything at once in interference or your attention is fully and completely engaged with a hyperfocusing interest and you lose awareness altogether of things you may be expected to keep track of and objects for recognition.

https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20241039

From the linked article: 

The recognition of same-sex marriage across the European Union has had a negative impact on the US economy, causing the number of highly skilled foreign workers seeking visas to drop by about 21%, according to a new study.

The list of countries that legally perform and recognize same-sex marriage now stands at 36 and continues to grow. Despite fears that same-sex marriage would undermine the institution of different-sex marriage, research has shown that, after 20 years, those fears were unfounded. Indeed, same-sex marriage has consistently been found to be positive for couples, their children, and the general population.

Now, a new study by researchers from Washington State University (WSU) has found that marriage equality also has a major economic benefit.

“This [study] just shows that having more inclusive policies can make a country more attractive for skilled labor,” said Koroles Awad, a PhD candidate in economics at WSU and the study’s lead author.

“In general, discriminatory policies are bad for the economy, and this is one way that shows it,” said Jill McCluskey, a WSU economics professor and the study’s co-author. “As a country, we should try to have all the people be able to fulfill their potential. If we have policies that are non-discriminatory, then everyone can do better, and it will be better for the country.”",65,0.9332

https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00399-0

From the linked article: 

MIT scientists have discovered an intriguing new way to produce hydrogen fuel, using just soda cans, seawater and coffee grounds. The team says the chemical reaction could be put to work powering engines or fuel cells in marine vehicles that suck in seawater.

In tests, a single pellet of aluminum weighing just 0.3 g (0.01 oz) placed in fresh, de-ionized water produced 400 ml of hydrogen in just five minutes. Scaled up, the team estimates that a single gram of pellets could generate an astonishing 1.3 L (0.3 gal) of hydrogen in five minutes.

The researchers propose that their recipe forms the basis of a practical hydrogen reactor that could be especially useful for powering marine vehicles.

“This is very interesting for maritime applications like boats or underwater vehicles because you wouldn’t have to carry around seawater – it’s readily available,” said Aly Kombargi, lead author of the study. “We also don’t have to carry a tank of hydrogen. Instead, we would transport aluminum as the ‘fuel,’ and just add water to produce the hydrogen that we need.”",9,0.8685

Link to the journal article [Cdk8/CDK19 promotes mitochondrial fission through Drp1 phosphorylation and can phenotypically suppress pink1 deficiency in Drosophila](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47623-8)

Abstract:

>Cdk8 in Drosophila is the orthologue of vertebrate CDK8 and CDK19. These proteins have been shown to modulate transcriptional control by RNA polymerase II. We found that neuronal loss of Cdk8 severely reduces fly lifespan and causes bang sensitivity. Remarkably, these defects can be rescued by expression of human CDK19, found in the cytoplasm of neurons, suggesting a non-nuclear function of CDK19/Cdk8. Here we show that Cdk8 plays a critical role in the cytoplasm, with its loss causing elongated mitochondria in both muscles and neurons. We find that endogenous GFP-tagged Cdk8 can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. We show that Cdk8 promotes the phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616, a protein required for mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, Pink1, a mitochondrial kinase implicated in Parkinson’s disease, also phosphorylates Drp1 at the same residue. Indeed, overexpression of Cdk8 significantly suppresses the phenotypes observed in flies with low levels of Pink1, including elevated levels of ROS, mitochondrial dysmorphology, and behavioral defects. In summary, we propose that Pink1 and Cdk8 perform similar functions to promote Drp1-mediated fission.",22,0.8971

t3_1ec43k2,"From the Llama 3.1 405B paper. (Training with synthetic data).

Synthetic data generation: execution feedback. The 8B and 70B models show significant performance
improvements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial
experiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can
even degrade performance). 

To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of truth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large dataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:

• Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem
descriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To
achieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model to generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide range of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).

• Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming
language. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the
generated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought
process in comments.

• Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is
not guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model’s
quality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. 

To achieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of
static and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:

– Static analysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic
correctness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported
functions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.

– Unit test generation and execution: For each problem and solution, we prompt the model
to generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution,
catching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.

• Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the
model to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution,
and feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). 

After a unit test execution failure, the model could either fix the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit tests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the final dataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions were initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution
feedback and improved its performance.

• Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds, with each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating higher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive
refinement and enhancement of the model’s performance.


2. Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between
major programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This
is not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate
this, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to
less common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). 

This is achieved by prompting Llama 3 and ensuring quality via syntax parsing, compilation, and execution. Figure 8 demonstrates an example of synthetic PHP code translated from Python. This improves performance significantly for less common languages as measured by the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark.


3. Synthetic data generation: backtranslation. To improve certain coding capabilities (e.g., documentation, explanations) where execution feedback is less informative for determining quality, we employ an alternative multi-step approach. Using this procedure, we generated approximately 1.2M synthetic...",42,0.9514

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.13007

From the linked article: 

Over the last few decades, America has witnessed a substantial decline in religiosity. Although the United States remains relatively religious compared to other nations, it is markedly less religious today than it was thirty years ago. However, a recent study published in Advances in Political Psychology uncovers an important nuance: secularism is distinct from mere nonreligiosity. The findings reveal that secularists form a unique group within the American electorate, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of secular trends is essential for grasping contemporary political dynamics.

While the increase in nonreligiosity, often termed “the rise of the nones,” has been widely documented, the new study sought to delve deeper into the distinctions between secularism and nonreligiosity. By doing so, the researchers aimed to clarify the political implications of these trends and how they might shape the future of American politics.

The study’s findings provide evidence that secularism is not simply the absence of religion but a distinctive identity characterized by specific beliefs and orientations. Unlike nonreligiosity, which denotes a lack of religious affiliation or belief, secularism involves an active identification with principles grounded in empirical evidence and rational thought. Secularists, therefore, are defined by what they believe in rather than what they lack.

For instance, secularists exhibited strong opposition to conspiracy theories. The researchers found that secularists are less likely to believe in various conspiracy theories compared to nonreligious individuals. This skepticism towards conspiracy theories is consistent with secularists’ reliance on empirical evidence and rational thought.

By contrast, nonreligiosity did not show a consistent relationship with opposition to conspiracy theories. This highlights the importance of the affirmative secular identity, which actively seeks evidence-based explanations and rejects unsubstantiated claims.

One of the most significant findings of the study is the strong association between secularism and liberal political attitudes. Secularists are more likely to support Democratic candidates and align with liberal policies compared to their nonreligious counterparts. This tendency is evident across various policy areas, including social welfare, environmental protection, and immigration.

The study also reveals that secularists are staunch supporters of core democratic values. Secularists exhibit strong support for participatory democracy, advocating for the inclusion of all individuals in the political process and the removal of barriers to voting. They also emphasize the importance of freedom of expression, opposing censorship and supporting the right to express even unpopular or controversial ideas.

Interestingly, the researchers found that liberals, particularly those identifying as very liberal, are generally unsupportive of allowing disliked groups such as “MAGA supporters,” “racists,” or “Muslim extremists” to hold rallies, teach, or have their books in local libraries. On the other hand, secularists, despite having similar disliked groups, are more likely than nonsecularists to extend civil liberties to these groups, demonstrating a higher level of political tolerance.",263,0.9894

First it just seems like we're talking about non religious people (aka atheists), but then it specifically says this is different to non-religious people (but I don't think it adequately explains why it's different) and otherwise seems to argue that this is a wider philosophical perspective about evidence based arguments, and then it starts contrasting versus 'liberals'?


So is a secularist just someone that (at the very least) thinks that their positions are based on empirical evidence over religious/spiritual evidence?

The “placebo” arm would not just be not given the vaccine under trial (against Alzheimer’s) but would unambiguously not be given the approved, trialled shingles vaccine.  If there is another equally effective and tolerated shingles vaccine that could be used as a control that might work,  it would complicate the trial: maybe it too is protective against dementia, which would make both look ineffective?

Given this publicity, no one properly informed would agree to take part in a trial: they would be increasing their risk of shingles, and possibly not receiving protection against Alzheimer’s.  For any individual, where is the downside of treatment?",14,0.6046

Turns out, according to an antibody test, I'm one of the <1% of people my age that never had chickenpox, and therefore theoretically aren't at risk of shingles... but did get a chickenpox vaccine in response to that test. 

But, of course... it's *possible*, though quite unlikely, that the antibody test was a false negative, and it would be worth suffering the rather strong side effects of the shingles vaccine...

t3_1ebzoeo,"New evidence indicates that the new shingles vaccine is more protective against dementia compared to the previous shingles vaccine, which was also reported to reduce dementia rates. It is also more protective than vaccines against other infections.

The study of more than 200,000 people by researchers at the University of Oxford funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre (OH BRC) found at least a 17% reduction in dementia diagnoses in the six years after the new recombinant shingles vaccination, equating to 164 or more additional days lived without dementia.

The findings suggest that the recombinant shingles vaccine may have additional value in terms of protection against dementia. Further research is needed to confirm this, and to identify how and why the vaccine has this effect.

Shingles is a painful and serious condition afflicting many elderly people. It is caused by the Herpes zoster virus that can flare up in people who previously had chicken pox. After the introduction of a vaccine against shingles (Zostavax) in 2006, several studies have suggested that the risk of dementia might be lower in people who had received the vaccine, although results were not conclusive. In many countries, including the UK and USA, Zostavax has now been withdrawn and replaced by a much more effective vaccine (Shingrix). In the UK, Shingrix is being offered by the NHS to all elderly people and certain other groups.

The collaborative project carried out by the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Oulu showed the prevalence of early-onset dementia (EOD) among working-age people by reviewing 12,490 patient records from Kuopio and Oulu University Hospitals between 2010 and 2021.

The study concluded that the incidence of Alzheimer's disease almost doubled among the working-age Finns over the 12-year follow-up period, while the incidence of other forms of EOD remained stable, the national broadcaster Yle reported.

According to findings in the population aged 65, the crude incidence of EOD was 12.3 out of 100,000 people based on 794 new cases from Jan. 1, 2010, to Dec. 31, 2021.

Incidence rates for EOD were 20.5 and 33.7 per 100,000 people in the age groups of 30-64 and 45-64, respectively.

The prevalence of EOD was 110.4 in the age group of 30–64 and 190.3 in 45-64 age group.

The study found that Alzheimer's disease which stood at 48.2% and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia at 12.7% were the most frequent subtypes of dementia.

t3_1ebx322,"From the article: Indiana University School of Medicine researchers have made a significant breakthrough in developing a new gene therapy approach that restores full-length dystrophin protein, which could lead to new treatments for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

The study, recently published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50569-6), demonstrates the effectiveness of their novel gene therapy technology in improving muscle tissue and overall strength in mice models with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in a lack of the protein dystrophin. This deficiency leads to progressive muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue over time. Patients with the disease experience impaired mobility, heart and lung problems, and ultimately a shortened life expectancy.

“Current gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy utilizes a truncated version of dystrophin,” said Renzhi Han, PhD, senior author of the study and professor of pediatrics at the IU School of Medicine. “Unfortunately, this option doesn’t fully protect the muscles because it lacks many important functional domains of full-length dystrophin.\"

While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved a micro-dystrophin gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Han said the therapeutic outcomes have been less satisfactory than expected.",3,0.802

\"Domestic abuse encompasses a range of damaging behaviors beyond physical violence, including economic and emotional abuse. We analyze the impact of cohabiting with an abusive partner on victims’ economic outcomes. In so doing, we highlight the systematic role of economic suppression in such relationships. Using Finnish administrative data and a matched control event study design, along with a within-individual comparison of outcomes across relationships, we document three new facts. First, women who begin relationships with (eventually) physically abusive men suffer large and significant earnings and employment falls immediately upon cohabiting with the abusive partner. Second, the decline in economic outcomes is non-monotonic in women’s pre-cohabitation outside options. Third, men who are violent against women in any capacity impose economic costs on all their female partners, even those who do not report physical violence. To rationalize these findings, we develop a new dynamic model of abusive relationships where women do not perfectly observe their partner’s type, and abusive men have an incentive to use economic suppression to sabotage women’s outside options and their ability to later exit the relationship.\"",16,-0.9939

Now, a study published in [Current Biology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.06.009) on Monday reports that chimpanzees follow a similar communication pattern structured around back-and-forth, fast-paced turns—albeit with gestures rather than speaking.

“Human conversation follows very strict rules of turn-taking that are consistent across cultures and languages,” Gal Badihi, an animal behavior researcher at the University of St Andrews in Scotland and first author of the study, tells the Guardian’s Tanya Procyshyn. “We started to wonder whether chimpanzee communication was governed by its own rules, or if the rules are similar to human conversation.”

Chimpanzee gestures are largely meant to convey requests, with “groom me,” “follow me,” “give me” or “stop it” being common commands. The researchers witnessed a variety of gestured interactions, such as chimps asking to change spots during grooming sessions. Once, a chimp named Ursus gave a reassuring tap to a chimp named Monica when she reached her hand out after a quarrel. In another instance, a male chimp repeatedly made “go away” gestures as a female asked for some meat from an antelope he had killed.

To explore patterns in this communication, the team of scientists collected footage of 8,559 gestures from 252 individuals in five chimp communities in eastern Africa, assembling the largest dataset of chimpanzee conversations ever made. They found that 14 percent of the recorded interactions included at least one response to a gesture, while some included as many as seven back-and-forth responses.

Then, the researchers timed the turns within conversations—in other words, they measured how long it took chimps to respond to each other. Chimps took an average of 120 milliseconds to reply with a gesture, which is not all that dissimilar from the human average of 200 milliseconds.",7,-0.1027

‘Miracle’ new anti-HIV jab could revolutionise virus prevention

Lenacapavir performed so well in clinical trials that researchers stopped the controlled test early

A “miracle” new anti-HIV jab giving protection from the deadly virus for six months is being hailed as a chance to revolutionise prevention of an infection which still kills one person every minute.

A large clinical trial spanning South Africa and Uganda has now shown Lenacapavir injections provided total protection in young African women for six months at a time. In contrast, the same trial found around two per cent of a group taking daily prevention pills catching HIV from partners.

The results could potentially revolutionise prevention.

High risk groups, such as young women, young gay men and injecting drug users could be given this new long-lasting PrEP jab and then allowed to carry on with their lives, only needing to have another shot twice a year.

Protection given by the antiviral drug is so strong and so long lasting that some have described it as “vaccine-like” in its potential.

Preliminary results from the trial attracted excitement in June. The full results of the trial have now been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The trial found Lenacapavir was so effective that not one of the 2,134 women given the drug became infected. The results were so clear cut that researchers stopped the trial early.",83,0.9367

PFASs do not easily break down in the environment, leading to their accumulation in water, soil, and even the bodies of humans, where they are known to cause carcinogenic effects and hormonal disruptions. Today, these chemicals can be found in drinking water supplies, food, and even in the soil of Antarctica. Although there are plans to phase out PFAS production, treating them remains challenging as they decompose only at temperatures exceeding 400 °C. As a result, certain amounts of products containing PFASs and PFs end up in landfills, potentially creating future contamination risks.

Now, a room-temperature defluorination method proposed by researchers at Ritsumeikan University could revolutionize PFAS treatment. Their study, published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International EditionNew window on 19 June 2024, details a photocatalytic method that uses visible light to break down PFAS and other fluorinated polymers (FPs) at room temperature into fluorine ions. Using this method, the researchers achieved 100% defluorination of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) within just 8 hours of light exposure.

t3_1ebo6i2,I think I remember a study like this before.

As such the industrials in France used the opportunity to export wine by financing studies to \"prove\" alcohol and especially wine protect the health. It has been debunked for 10-15 years now, I think ...

It shows that science need more safeguards to prevent being manipulated for monetary or political gains. It happened in France this time but it certainly happens everywhere in the world. Also, people's health is more important than money or a tiny bit of glory by having some miraculous red wine. To hell if it hurts our exports, this should be known more.

https://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsad.23-00283

From the linked article: 

For the regular boozer it is a source of great comfort: the fat pile of studies that say a daily tipple is better for a longer life than avoiding alcohol completely.

But a new analysis challenges the thinking and blames the rosy message on flawed research that compares drinkers with people who are sick and sober.

Scientists in Canada delved into 107 published studies on people’s drinking habits and how long they lived. In most cases, they found that drinkers were compared with people who abstained or consumed very little alcohol, without taking into account that some had cut down or quit through ill health.

The finding means that amid the abstainers and occasional drinkers are a significant number of sick people, bringing the group’s average health down, and making light to moderate drinkers look better off in comparison.

“It’s been a propaganda coup for the alcohol industry to propose that moderate use of their product lengthens people’s lives,” said Dr Tim Stockwell, first author on the study and a scientist at the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research at the University of Victoria.

“The idea has impacted national drinking guidelines, estimates of alcohol’s burden of disease worldwide and has been an impediment to effective policymaking on alcohol and public health,” he added. Details are published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.",627,-0.8641

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222429241256570

From the linked article: 

Researchers from North Carolina State University, University of Manitoba, Bern University of Applied Sciences, University of South Carolina, and California Baptist University published a new Journal of Marketing study that explores whether the onset of daylight saving time leads consumers to engage in unhealthy behaviors.

Changing clocks twice a year is a tradition for most people living in the United States, with the spring transition to daylight saving time raising the ire of many due to the loss of an hour of sleep.

This new Journal of Marketing study explores whether the onset of daylight saving time leads consumers to engage in unhealthy behaviors. The researchers examine social media data from X (formerly Twitter) to study consumer responses to the onset of daylight saving time. They say that “the number of tweets with keywords related to the disruptive nature of the switch to daylight saving time peaked around 12 hours after the change occurred. We also find that the volume of negatively toned tweets rose more substantially, indicating a stronger increase in negative sentiment toward the time change. Overall, our preliminary findings suggests that consumers respond negatively to the switch to daylight saving time.”

Results show that:

- calorie consumption from largely unhealthy snacks increases following the time change and

- visits to fitness centers decrease.

The effect on calorie consumption is amplified during the evening hours and for cloudy days. Further, visits to fitness centers are reduced among fitness center members who live farther away and who do not visit the fitness centers regularly. Finally, the researchers examine the effect of the transition from daylight saving time to standard time (during fall) and find that there is no effect of the fall transition on calories consumed from unhealthy snacks. These results highlight the role of sleepiness caused by the one-hour setback, which impairs consumers’ self-control and leads to less healthy consumption behavior.",5,0.3427

t3_1ebdw0n,"Basically -very poor people live in areas that will be/are affected by climate change and also have more child marriages. The more vulnerable women are the more likely they are to be used as a commodity. 





Conclusions
This work has contributed by econometrically unveiling the channels through which climate change operates on a county´s rate of child marriages using cross sectional analyses with a sample of up to 208 countries. The effect of climate change vulnerability on child marriage have been elucidated using structural equations models (SEM) and controlling by economic and social aspects.

The principal findings are related to a high correlation between climate change vulnerability and child marriage. They elucidate the high negative correlation between a country´s high vulnerability to climate change and some of its most relevant not only economic, but also socioeconomic indicators, such as income and extreme poverty. Additionally, we also elucidate the high correlation of a country´s rate of child marriages with its rate of gender inequality and its income level, which is in line with the results of other studies (Hotchkiss et al., 2016).

Furthermore, the effect of climate change vulnerability exhibits a double channel incidence on child marriage. On the one hand, it indirectly affects child marriage through a channel which would operate because vulnerable countries are more prone to climatic and natural disasters, which as the literature shows, affects the poorest among the poor and the unprotected women and children (Alston et al., 2014; Bhadwal et al., 2019; Kumala Dewi & Dartanto, 2019; Ziegler et al., 2019). On the other hand, if climate change is already occurring -as most of the scientific literature shows- vulnerable countries are, and will be, more affected than non-vulnerable countries.Footnote5

Thereby we have shown here that child marriage is a complex issue, which have several dimensions of different natures and, therefore, should be addressed from different perspectives, such as the reduction of extreme poverty and of poor segments of the population, on the one hand, and the rise of countries’ general income level in developing countries, on the other hand. Moreover, at the same time, it is paramount to insist in promoting more strict laws and norms which prevent child marriage and include women in the educational system because of the existing evidence relating child marriage with the access to education for women (Hotchkiss et al., 2016; Male & Wodon, 2018; Subramanian, 2008; Wodon, 2018). Furthermore, the impulse of public and private policies against gender inequality and inequity is crucial to achieve a cultural change in terms of the role of women and the elimination of gender discrimination.",3,-0.9743

> Results Patients were twice as more often heavy alcohol users compared with controls (13.7% vs 6.7%, p<0.001), were more likely to have hypertension and they were more often current smokers, overweight and physically inactive. In the entire study population, heavy alcohol consumption was independently associated with CIS (adjusted OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.22 to 3.63). In sex-specific analysis, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with CIS in men (2.72; 95% CI 1.25 to 5.92), but not in women (1.56; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.41). When exploring the association with binge drinking alone, a significant association was shown in the entire cohort (2.43; 95% CI 1.31 to 4.53) and in men (3.36; 95% CI 1.44 to 7.84), but not in women.

> Conclusions Heavy alcohol consumption, particularly binge drinking, appears to be an independent risk factor in young men with CIS.

Not doubting it but they haven’t convinced me on *independent* risk factor. I’m glad the concluded ‘appears to be’ an independent risk factor. 

It’s hard to tell but have they controlled for all variables? weight, smoking, cocaine use, ldl, triglycerides. These all seem to be factors more likely to correlate directly with incidence that are indirectly influenced by alcohol. 

Also what is the population incidence of CIS in this demographic? I assume it would be very small while the relative prevalence of alcohol excess and binge drinking would be comparatively much higher in certain populations where alcohol is freely available and culturally acceptable. Or in a more prohibitive culture both sample sizes would be small

Also self reported measure, risk of reporting bias or higher risk of social desirability bias among control group",12,0.5878

t3_1ebbcfn,The main issue with weight loss isn't what diet they're doing or what their eating window is. It's a compliance issue. Getting a patient to stick to ANY kind of diet restricting calories takes nearly Herculean effort. The big selling point of intermittent fasting is that you get used to being hungry and can focus on getting the meals you do eat right. Not that it's more effective than eating at the same functional caloric deficit.,243,-0.4951
t3_1ebbcfn,"Not surprising considering the reason IF works relative to other diets in real life settings is because it’s easier to stick to.

t3_1ebbcfn,"To be fair, I don't believe there are almost any proponents of intermittent fasting that would suggest a 10-hour eating window would be small enough to elicit the proposed benefits.  

While there is certainly some heterogeneity in the rodent studies they mention, I have not seen any that use such a long eating window. 

I'm a long time proponent of IF, but to be honest I do think the mechanism of improved weight loss is probably calorie restriction.  But I don't take anything from a 10-hour eating window to prove or disprove that.

 This was unfortunately a promising study let down by their choice of poor parameters.",25,0.5346
t3_1ebbcfn,"It's more effective for many because it's psychologically easier to be consistent and adhere to. A scientific study is the opposite of a real world success rate precisely because someone is literally making sure you stick to your calorie deficit.

And if you’re prone to binging you have to either learn not to binge during your eating window or the method could making binging behavior worse. 

I think another thing is that some people may need “permission” to choose to not eat. 3 meals a day plus snacking and sugar filled drinks in between have been drilled into us culturally.

t3_1ebbcfn,"The research on pretty much all dieting is the same: it's caloric deficit. No matter what you do, if you're in a deficit, you'll be losing weight.

A lot of the methods that exist otherwise are just designed to cause a calorie deficit. One example is increasing your fiber intake dramatically, which makes you feel more full and affects the speed of digestion. Less calories are absorbed, meaning you'll be in a deficit. 

Here's a great study (meta-analysis) that showed if you increase fiber intake, even if you don't change your diet, you'll lose fat:

The tricky part is how we achieve calorie deficit while maintaining the amount eaten. I personally think the main way is to focus on increasing veggie intake.

I really like big meals and I really like snacking at night. IM really helps with both those, also I have a few favorite cheats, my go to when I feel like being a fatty:

Family sized bag of salad, throw in some taco meat or cut up breaded chicken strips and for the dressing mix in a healthy portion of greek yogurt so you need less volume of the fatty stuff. I usually add some bacon as well as salad topper (nuts and cranberries). This salad is comically large, delicious and I sit around after rubbing my belly happy as can be and the meal was maybe 1000 calories (at most) and contains like 60G of protein.  

I also buy riced cauliflower, puree it with some almond milk and use it 50/50 with mashed potatoes with greek yogurt then throw over my butter chicken or meat sauce. Again, maybe 1000 calories in total but we're talking a laughable portion of food.

t3_1ebbcfn,"It's all about breaking bad habits. Some people should choose to eat three, four or five tiny, healthy meals a day and calorie count everything. Some people should eat a moderate sized, healthy meal once a day in the middle of the day, and not eat again until for 18 or 24 hours.

Use whichever method helps you to break your bad eating habits. The latter works for me. I don't want to even think about food or going to the fridge until tomorrow lunchtime. 

When I try calorie counting I'm ravenous all the time, and eating becomes a focal point throughout the day - an obsession. My activities are just 'doing something for a handful of hours until the next meal time.' I don't like splitting my day up into mealtimes.

But when I do OMAD fasting, after the first week my hunger diminishes and becomes a small itch that I don't have to scratch (I believe that's because my insulin falls and evens out), and dissipates entirely if I keep myself busy. My activities become my focal points, not my mealtimes.

It works arms, back muscles, and legs if a person does this without a board, too. It's the lowest resistance and the easiest for anyone with injuries or body aches.

Walking/hiking smallish hills one hour every other day, that's a legs day.

Generally all people wanting to lose weight need to do some kind of exercise for 1 hour a day every day, and aim for 2,000 calories or less. Because the body needs to burn off more than it's consuming.

Even if a person is terrified of working out in public, there are tons of things a person can do in their own homes. Dancing is one. Youtube has plenty of home gym type videos for free.

Scrubbing the walls of a shower and the tub itself, that's an arms day right there. Do that once a week.

Washing the car? That's an arms day, and a few squats, too, around the wheels and baseboards. Vacuuming in a car? Whole body workout.

Kon Mari your whole house? Lifting bags of clothes, books, etc, that's another arms and back day.

I think part of the food addiction is people are wired to engage in movement. And if we do movement in other things, folding clothes, washing car, sipping water while walking the neighborhood, that is doing something. Our body wants to keep moving.

I read the Average American is eating 3000-35000 calories a day, it's just empty calories mostly from chips, sodas, candies, ice creams, and fries and other junk foods.

t3_1eb5e36,">How Feminist Heterosexual Men Navigate Their Sexual Desire While Following Feminist Principles

>Abstract

>Feminist considerations have influenced how women and men view sex, affecting not only women's perspectives but also men’s feelings about sexual desire with regard to gender equity. This might be especially the case among men who self-identify as feminist. However, how men should manage their sexual desire or communicate about it within relationships with women is not always clear in this evolving social climate. Thus, the current study aimed to explore the successes and/or struggles feminist heterosexual men experience while navigating their desires alongside feminist considerations. To explore this, we recruited feminist-identified heterosexual men in long-term relationships. We asked participants (*N* = 30) a series of questions regarding their sexual desire, considering the context of their long-term relationships and evolving gender norms, during a one-on-one interview via Zoom. Using thematic analysis, we identified 11 themes from the interview data. We found that, though the feminist men in this study were all aware of negative societal perceptions of heterosexual men’s sexual desire, most men in this study did not feel conflicts between their feminist principles and their own sexual desires. This is because they reported already following feminist principles; those who felt ambivalent navigated this by communicating with their partners. Findings demonstrate the usefulness and positive impact men report feminism having on them, their sexuality, and their long-term relationships, by allowing them to better engage with their sexuality and partners.",9,0.9818

t3_1eb5e36,"From the article: Sexual desire has traditionally been viewed as a simple and singular phenomenon, often associated with the pursuit of sexual pleasure, particularly orgasm. Contemporary research views sexual desire as a multifaceted experience influenced by various situational and psychological factors. For men, sexual desire is often framed in terms of masculinity, with societal expectations dictating that men should always have high levels of sexual desire. This traditional view overlooks the complexity of men’s sexual desire and the experiences of those who do not fit this stereotype.

Feminism has brought significant changes in how sexual desire is perceived and expressed, particularly among men who identify as feminists. These men often face the challenge of reconciling their sexual desires with feminist principles that promote gender equity and respect. In this work, researchers Eun Ju Son and colleagues explored the experiences of feminist heterosexual men in long-term relationships.

The [researchers](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-024-02914-5) recruited 30 self-identified feminist heterosexual men in long-term relationships to participate in one-on-one interviews via Zoom. Participants, who were primarily recruited from the Kingston community in Canada, were between the ages 21 to 57 years, with an average relationship duration of 9.54 years. Participants were interviewed by one of four interviewers for approximately 45 minutes. The interviewers followed a set script with eight primary questions, supplemented by follow-up questions to probe deeper into the participants’ experiences and feelings.",-2,0.9681

He spots the issue with his analysis, but hand waves it away.

> The answer to this question is not difficult. It is the high autocorrelation, which results in some explained variance, as any value in a time series contains some information about its close neighbors due to time dependence.

> Figure 11 shows the empirical autocorrelation functions of the 
CO2 series, original and differenced. In the instrumental series, the autocorrelations are almost 1, even for lags as high as 100. This prohibits any inference from the original series. However, their differenced series have reasonable positive autocorrelations, which make inference possible. **The proxy series have high autocorrelations at small lags, but reasonable ones at large lags.** For those, both the original and the differenced series are examined, provided that the latter are positive.

Then looking at all the following data. I see what looks graphs looking like the 'hen or egg' scenario that the author talks about... ie, auto-correlation.

I look at the data provided, and I see that CO2 and temperature are too closely correlated to say definitively one came before the other... particularly since the author makes no attempt to study what would happen if there was 'variance' in the data.

This 'too close to call' argument is the same argument that the author uses to dismiss the data from others... but does a poor job of explaining why his analysis is somehow better.

t3_1eb530w,"\"While there is a close relationship between temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concertation, it is temperature that leads, while [CO2] lags. That is, the causality direction is T-> [CO2] and not the opposite, as emphatically promoted in the last decades. This is the case not only in the distant past and on large time scales, but also in the recent period covered by reliable instrumental records. This happens not only at the monthly or annual time scale, but also at the decadal time scale, which can be resolved by the existing data sets.

In conclusion, both the paleoclimatic and the instrumental data confirm the same causality direction T -> [CO2] for all time scales, from very large to very short, and all periods. The mechanisms responsible to this causality direction are physical, related to the interaction of oceans and atmosphere, but mostly are related to the biosphere processes. Did human actions, such as fossil fuel combustion and other presumed 'unnatural' actions, reverse directionality, as the popular claim is? Perhaps, but no analysis based on observational data has shown that. Rather, such claims are based on imagination and climatic models full of assumptions. However, as shown in [22] the causality direction in time series produced by climatic models is opposite to that of the real-world data.\"",1,0.7227

\"General circulation models (GCMs) are the foundation of weather and climate prediction1,2. GCMs are physics-based simulators that combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine-learning models trained on reanalysis data have achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting3,4. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present a GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best machine-learning and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with machine-learning models for one- to ten-day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for one- to fifteen-day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140-kilometre resolution show emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs, although our model does not extrapolate to substantially different future climates. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.\"",4,0.8572

[Evidence of dark oxygen production at the abyssal seafloor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01480-8)

Abstract:

>Deep-seafloor organisms consume oxygen, which can be measured by in situ benthic chamber experiments. Here we report such experiments at the polymetallic nodule-covered abyssal seafloor in the Pacific Ocean in which oxygen increased over two days to more than three times the background concentration, which from ex situ incubations we attribute to the polymetallic nodules. Given high voltage potentials (up to 0.95 V) on nodule surfaces, we hypothesize that seawater electrolysis may contribute to this dark oxygen production.

From the main discussion:

>On the basis of these studies and DOP being observed in nodule-only ex situ incubations (Extended Data Fig. 4), we hypothesize that the DOP may have partly resulted from seawater electrolysis, with the necessary energy coming from the potential difference between metal ions within the nodule layers, leading to an internal redistribution of electrons. Whereas questions remain concerning this potential mechanism (such as the identity of the energy source(s), longevity of DOP, catalytic stabilities, electrochemical conditions on exposed versus buried nodules surfaces and the influence of different chemistries within the nodule layers), the ‘geo-battery’ hypothesis was supported by the link between DOP and nodule average surface area. This connection could be due to an increased abundance of anode and cathode sites or a greater abundance of high Ni and Cu dendritic porous layers in larger nodules. Assuming the ‘geo-battery’ is partly responsible for the DOP observed, the initial high DOP rate may have been related to the ‘bow-wave’ of the lander removing sediments from the surface of the nodules and exposing electrochemically active sites on the nodules. The slowdown in DOP seen later in the incubations could have then been caused by a reduction in voltage potential and/or degradation of metal-oxide catalysts that has been observed in Mn oxide catalysts previously. Whereas this process requires further investigation, if true, DOP activity may fluctuate with sediment coverage on the nodules inviting the urgent question of how sediment remobilization and distribution over large areas during deep-sea mining may influence DOP.
>
>Understanding the mechanism(s) behind DOP, its temporal nature and its spatial distribution will allow its role in abyssal ocean ecosystems to be better understood. Future studies of DOP in the deep sea may also shed light on broader relationships between metal-oxide deposition, biological evolution and the oxygenation of Earth.",11,0.9662

t3_1eb4bki,"This interesting topic brings to mind the criticism that Cordelia Fine offers in her book, \\*Delusions of Gender\\*. In essence, her primary argument suggests that while both gender and sex have a significant impact on life experiences, it does not necessarily follow that any statistically significant sexually dimorphic differences in the brain are hardwired from birth, as it is methodologically very challenging or impossible to isolate the variables needed to prove such a hypothesis experimentally. 

I acknowledge that statistically significant sexual dimorphism in the brain does exist; however, I believe it can be quite challenging, if not impossible, to definitively isolate life experiences as a variable causing those differences versus the idea that these differences are innate from birth.

It’s important to note that gender is not the only aspect influenced by socio-cultural factors; biological sex is also shaped by these factors. For example, the study linked here mentions in their findings that children assigned male at birth (AMAB) show greater sex congruence in their genders compared to children assigned female at birth (AFAB). The summary states: \"Extant literature suggests that AMAB children feel more pressure to conform to gender norms than AFAB children (27, 28). This may, in part, explain our results, in which AMAB children report stronger sex-congruent genders than AFAB children.\"

This indicates that the greater sex congruence observed in AMAB children may stem from socio-cultural pressures rather than being solely hardwired from birth. I must confess that I only skimmed this study, but it is encouraging that the authors appear to recognize the complexities in disentangling the influences of nature versus nurture, particularly concerning biological sex differences in neurology, not just gender.

Conducting a scientific investigation into neurological sexual dimorphism while ruling out nurture as a variable poses considerable challenges. Any methodology that attempts to completely isolate the \"nurture\" aspect would be either impractical or ethically questionable, as it is impossible to raise a child devoid of any nurturing influence.

I would suggest that even studies involving newborn infants cannot entirely exclude variables such as maternal diet choices during pregnancy based on gender preferences, such as eating more protein for a \"big strong boy\" or sweets for a \"sweet little girl.\" While this methodology might control for nurture to some extent compared to many current studies, it still cannot eliminate it completely.

Ultimately, to thoroughly determine if a purely \"nature,\" hardwired form of sexual dimorphism exists in the brain, it seems that a methodologically rigorous scientific approach would require the absence of the social construct of gender, thereby eliminating any nurturing-related variables. Unfortunately, achieving that scenario appears to be unlikely.",13,0.9814

“Sex and Gender Map onto Different Brain Networks in Children”

“A preliminary study suggests that sex and gender are represented differently in the brain”

“A new brain-imaging study of young adolescents has shown that sex and gender map onto different brain networks. The findings, published on Friday in Science Advances, demonstrate the importance of considering the social impact of gender in neuroscience research rather than conflating it with physiological sex.

“Moving forward, we really need to consider both sex and gender separately if we want to better understand the brain,” said study co-author Elvisha Dhamala, a neuroscientist at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, in a recent press conference.

Physiological sex is largely determined by chromosomes, genes, hormones and other biological systems. On top of that, cultural ideas about what it means to be, for example, a man, woman or nonbinary person—what we call gender—also play a critical role shaping people’s life and behavior. Scientists understand sex and gender to be related yet distinct concepts, but they are often conflated in neuroscience research. This means that differences between the brains of people who are assigned male or female at birth are often taken as reflections of biological differences when they could very well be the result of how each group is treated based on cultural expectations.

“The influence of being treated as a woman or as a man in our society is ignored” in neuroscience research, says Lara M. Wierenga, a neuroscientist who studies gender differences in brain development at Leiden University in the Netherlands and was not involved in the new research. “But we also know that the brain is very plastic, very open to experiences,” which can differ greatly between people assigned female or male at birth, she says.

For the new study, Dhamala’s team wanted to know what the field might be missing by ignoring the social impact of gender. The researchers worked with data from a large and ongoing longitudinal study of U.S. adolescents to compare brain scan data with questionnaire responses about the participants’ sex and gender from them and their parents.

While the researchers expected sex to be associated with differences in activity in certain brain networks, beyond that, “we had no idea whether or not [gender] would map onto the brain and also no idea where it would map onto the brain,” Dhamala says.

The study researchers analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 4,757 children aged nine or 10 years old. The fMRI scanner captured “resting-state” activity across different brain regions that occurs when someone is awake but not engaged in a specific task. The young participants had also been asked four questions about their feelings about their gender (such as “How much do you feel like a boy?”), and their parents had been asked 12 questions about how their child talked about their gender and how they engaged in play activities that are stereotypically “for boys” or “for girls.”

The researchers fed the brain-scan data, along with information about each participant’s sex, into a machine-learning model, which learned to pick out subtle differences in the activity of certain regions of the brain between the male and female groups. Then they tested the model on data it had not yet seen by asking it to predict participants’ sex based on their brain scans, which it accomplished with 77 percent accuracy.

Next, the researchers went on to train another machine-learning model to make predictions from the preteens’ and parents’ reports about gender. But because sex and gender are so strongly related to each other, the brain networks associated with each largely overlapped. To bring gender into clearer view, the team analyzed the participants’ gender variation separately by sex. This showed how and where brain activity differed between people who had been assigned the same sex at birth but had varying feelings and expression of their gender.

Finally, the researchers compared the networks associated with gender differences with those associated with sex differences. They found that while there was some overlap, these groups of networks were largely different from one another, though this difference was only statistically significant for the parent-reported gender data, not the self-reports. (The study authors think the self-report questionnaire was not sensitive enough to capture differences in how children think and feel about their gender.)

The brain networks unique to sex but not gender included networks with more well-defined roles in the brain, such as the visual network and motor network. Conversely, the networks that showed gender but not sex differences were more dispersed throughout the brain. It’s too soon to draw conclusions about why some networks were associated with sex and not gender and vice versa, Dhamala says: “We have no idea right now” if those differences relate to differences in behavior.

“This is really the first time that it’s shown in such a large dataset that not only sex but also gender is related to the way the brain is wired,” Wierenga says. “The expectations that we have [based on gender], they do matter.” This is important to understand because gender-related differences in the brain could impact how psychiatric disorders manifest across the gender spectrum, especially those that are underdiagnosed in people who were assigned female at birth (such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD) or who were assigned male (such as anxiety and mood disorders), Wierenga says.

Because the research was only done in children, it’s also not clear whether gender would map onto the brain differently from sex in adults, though Wierenga says she expects that this pattern would hold.

Dhamala’s team plans to rerun similar analyses on the same group of children as they grow. “These are still very young kids. And as they go through adolescence and into adulthood, their brain networks and their functional connectivity is going to be changing,” she says. In the meantime, the researchers say, other teams could begin testing gender as well as sex in their research to yield a clearer picture of brain-based differences throughout life.”",40,0.6995

t3_1eb0vui,"From the article: A team of Australian scientists is genetically engineering a common fly species so that it can eat more of humanity’s organic waste while producing ingredients for making everything from lubricants and biofuels to high-grade animal feeds.

Black soldier flies are already being used commercially to consume organic waste, including food waste, but tweaking their genetics could widen the range of waste their larvae consume while, in the process, producing fatty compounds and enzymes.

In a [scientific paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06516-8), the team based at Sydney’s Macquarie University outlined their hopes for the flies and how they could also cut the amount of planet-warming methane produced when organic waste breaks down.

“We are heading towards a climate disaster, and landfill waste releases methane. We need to get that to zero,” Dr Kate Tepper, a lead author of the paper, said.

Dr Maciej Maselko runs an animal synthetic biology lab at Macquarie University where Tepper has already started engineering the flies.

Maselko said insects would be the “next frontier” in dealing with the planet’s waste management problem, which weighs in at about 1bn tonnes a year in food waste alone.

Black soldier flies are found in all continents except Antarctica. “If you’ve got a compost bin, then you’ve probably got some,” Maselko said.

New CU Boulder research published July 17 in the journal \"Science Advances\" shows that, when reawakened, they can play a critical role in helping cancer survive and thrive. The study also suggests that silencing certain endogenous retroviruses can make cancer treatments work better.

“Our study shows that diseases today can be significantly influenced by these ancient viral infections that until recently very few researchers were paying attention to,” said senior author Edward Chuong, an assistant professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at CU Boulder's BioFrontiers Institute.

From the linked article: 

With their huge size, venomous bite and the fantastical connotations of their name, Komodo dragons seem like the stuff of legend.

Now, that status has been elevated further: scientists have discovered that their teeth are coated with a layer of iron that helps keep their serrated edges razor sharp.

It is the first time such a coating has been seen in any animal, and one the researchers describe as “a striking and previously overlooked predatory adaptation in the Komodo dragon”.

The coating was discovered when researchers noticed that the tips and serrated edges of Komodo dragons’ teeth were covered in a layer of orange pigment. On closer inspection, the enamel was found to contain concentrated iron that makes the teeth extra hard and resistant to wear, helping the dragons rip and tear their prey apart.

Komodo dragons’ curved, serrated teeth are a similar shape to those of carnivorous dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex. In the study, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, LaBlanc and his team set out to use the similarity to learn more about how dinosaur teeth might have been used when they were alive.",97,0.9371

A significant portion of this revenue comes from microtransactions — small in-game purchases that enhance the gaming experience. Among these, loot boxes, which offer random virtual items, have sparked considerable debate due to their similarity to gambling.

A recent study published in [Scientific Reports](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64812-z) explored whether gamers with autistic traits are more susceptible to excessive gaming and problematic gambling behaviors, and their spending patterns on loot boxes. Surprisingly, the study found that while gamers with higher levels of autistic traits may be more vulnerable to excessive gaming and problematic gambling, they actually spend less on loot boxes when their gambling symptoms are accounted for.

“Video gaming as a hobby has evolved substantially over the years, with how people access and play video games shifting along with technological advancements. Research into this increasingly popular hobby has grown in response,” said study author James D. Sauer of the University of Tasmania.

“One such change in the gaming industry includes the rise of the microtransaction monetization model. This allows games companies to accrue revenue from their product by offering additional, optional, in-game purchases. ‘Loot boxes’ are a particular type of microtransaction that has become prevalent within video games, and has received considerable attention from game users and researchers alike.”",8,0.0534

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-024-01685-3

From the linked article: 

Researchers have combined the bacteria-killing actions of two classes of antibiotics into one, demonstrating that their new dual-action antibiotic could make bacterial resistance (almost) an impossibility.

Pathogens such as bacteria threaten human health, so we dole out antibiotics. The bacteria then develop resistance to the antibiotics. While bacterial threat remains the same, our treatment arsenal is less effective, if it’s effective at all. In essence, that’s the problem caused by antibiotic resistance.

But now, researchers from the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) may have replenished the arsenal with a new antibiotic, one that could make it nearly impossible for bacteria to develop resistance to.

“The beauty of this antibiotic is that it kills through two different targets in bacteria,” said Alexander Mankin, distinguished professor of pharmaceutical sciences at UIC and the study’s co-corresponding author. “If the antibiotic hits both targets at the same concentration, then the bacteria lose their ability to become resistant via [the] acquisition of random mutations in any of the two targets.”

“By basically hitting two targets at the same concentration, the advantage is that you make it almost impossible for the bacteria to easily come up with a simple genetic defense,” said Yury Polikanov, associate professor of biological sciences and another of the study’s corresponding authors.

Based on their results, the researchers estimated that their macrolone antibiotic “would make it 100 million times more difficult for bacteria to evolve resistance.”",26,0.145
t3_1eavld4,"They suggest that a pathogen with no resistance is unlikely to develop resistance. However, a pathogen which already has one resistance mechanism (e.g. efflux) can quite conceivably develop the second mechanism (e.g. modification/mutation of the target or enzymatic degradation).",4,-0.296

I mean, just don't prescribe them until the resistance against them is selected out of the bacterial gene pool.

t3_1eamtf4,"A study indicates that memory is not limited to humans but also exists in bacteria

In a recent study, researchers lead by Dr. Ilana Kolodkin-Gal of Reichman University’s Scojen Institute for Synthetic Biology discovered that probiotics and biological control agents like Bacillus subtilis possess memory.

Even when the bacteria separate from their host, they can continue to express genes related to colonization and symbiosis for several generations. The ability to effectively recolonize a new host is provided by this information transfer between generations of bacteria, which gives them an advantage over naïve bacteria that have never established a stable connection with a plant.

The significance of the defenses that the bacteria develop during plant colonization is shown by the association between stress resistance and the genes with multigenerational inheritance patterns. The interactions between the beneficial bacteria and their host are stabilized through this multigenerational inheritance. According to the researchers, comparable mechanisms allow good probiotic bacteria from the same group to interact across generations in the human gut, providing long-term disease prevention.

https://amp.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/23/sharks-brazil-positive-cocaine

From the above article:

Wild sharks off the coast of Brazil have tested positive for cocaine, according to new study by Brazilian scientists, in the latest research to demonstrate how illegal drug consumption by humans is harming marine life.

According to a study entitled Cocaine Shark and published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, scientists dissected the bodies of 13 sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon lalandii) caught in fishermen’s nets off a beach in Rio de Janeiro.

All 13 tested positive for the drug.

A separate study recently revealed that high levels of cocaine residue were causing “serious toxicological effects” in animals such as brown mussels, oysters and eels in Santos Bay, in the Brazilian state of São Paulo.

But the concentration found in the Rio sharks was 100 times higher than had been found in other marine animals, the researchers said.

How the cocaine ended up in the sharks remains a mystery.

There are a few possibilities: one is that the drug fell in the sea during transshipment or was dumped in the sea by smugglers attempting to evade authorities.

Brazil does not produce large amounts of cocaine, but is a major exporter, with powerful street gangs such as the First Capital Command (PCC) sending tonnes of the drug in shipping containers to Europe.

Another possible explanation is that the cocaine reached the sea in sewage discharges – and from there passed into the sharks.",1,0.0129

t3_1eaiw5a,"Well, current research shows THC binds mostly to CB1 receptor, and it binds it strongly. Previous research shows binding this receptor too strongly promotes paranoia and worsened anxiety, consistent with the observed effect that some marijuana can relieve anxiety whereas too much can worsen it. 

The role of CBD is thought to be a CB1 partial agonist, meaning it binds the receptor but not nearly as strongly. This should reduce the overall binding of THC and reduce the paranoia and anxiety associated with too strong of binding, as some of the THC-CB1 receptor bonds have been broken by the partial agonist CBD. 

This research looked mostly at functional MRI connectivity networks such as the salience network and ECN. It basically shows that the \"disruption\" of these networks is still present with both THC alone and THC+CBD administration. The authors are kind of speculating that this indicates the patients experience of the intoxicating effects of these substances is the same with THC alone and with THC+CBD alone. However they did not measure the patients subjective experience at all, and that is likely to be done in a future study. 

Overall it is an interesting thesis and future research may show the authors conclusion to be correct, but I'm not convinced it is demonstrated here. It would certainly upend some of the current teaching surrounding THC and CBD so I'm curious to see the future research",202,-0.0437

t3_1eaiw5a,"From the article: In a recent study published in the journal [Neuropsychopharmacology](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01891-6), researchers have found that cannabidiol (CBD) does not mitigate the disruptive effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain connectivity. In fact, the study suggests that CBD might even exacerbate these effects in some cases. This challenges the commonly held belief that CBD can counterbalance the psychoactive impact of THC in cannabis.

The research was motivated by the growing use of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, a period characterized by significant brain development. Previous studies indicated that chronic cannabis use during adolescence could lead to changes in brain connectivity and cognitive impairments. However, there was a lack of detailed research on the acute effects of cannabis in this age group, especially considering the different compositions of cannabis with varying levels of THC and CBD.

THC is the main psychoactive component, responsible for the euphoric “high” and cognitive alterations associated with cannabis use. CBD, on the other hand, is non-psychoactive and has been suggested to have potential therapeutic properties, such as reducing anxiety and possessing anti-inflammatory effects. While THC binds directly to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, influencing mood, perception, and cognition, CBD interacts more subtly with these receptors and can modulate the effects of THC.

The study was conducted as part of the larger “CannTeen” project and involved 48 semi-regular cannabis users. The participants were evenly divided into two groups: 24 adolescents with a mean age of 17.2 years and 24 adults with a mean age of 27.8 years. The selection criteria ensured that participants had used cannabis between 0.5 and 3 days per week over the past three months. The researchers aimed to match the cannabis use frequency between the adolescent and adult groups.",3,0.9255

But if we are going to talk about the effects of sunscreen on coral health, zinc oxide is actually one of the more toxic filters to coral (this pigment was used in combination with zinc — though perhaps it works similarly with organic filters, idk). This is harm-reducing by reducing the concentration of zinc, but still using one of the more toxic filters to coral.

I’m also curious as to how this affects UVA protection. As an SPF booster, it may not actually offer the UVA protection of the zinc it’s displacing in a sunscreen formula. This happens in a lot of newer “100% mineral” sunscreens that use butyloctyl salicylate as an “inactive” ingredient. And unfortunately we don’t have a great selection of approved UV filters with good long-wavelength UV absorption in the US.

t3_1eaal9g,"Scientists have discovered that some cancer cells pretend to be ‘super fit’ to fool normal healthy cells into giving them their nutrients, allowing them to expand and spread around the body.

A team from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, found that ‘cheating’ cancer cells develop the ability to hijack the body’s natural ‘cell competition’ process, which ensures that substandard cells do not accumulate but instead are killed and removed.

The researchers, based in the Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and largely funded by Breast Cancer Now, hope that having a better understanding of how the cell competition mechanism is exploited by cancer cells will lead to new ways of treating the disease.

Normally, this evolutionary principle of ‘survival of the fittest’ is a crucial quality control mechanism for maintaining tissue health and function. However, defects in cell competition can result in the retention of damaged or dangerous cells, potentially triggering the formation of tumours.

Most of drug expiration dates information is from the study conducted by the Food and Drug Administration at the request of the military.

From the linked article:

When it comes to crewed missions to Mars there is no shortage of hazards, from space radiation to a hostile environment. Now researchers have found another snag: many of the medicines astronauts may take with them are likely to expire before they return to Earth.

Researchers say they have discovered a host of medications used in space have a shelf life of three years or less – a problem given Nasa expects a mission to Mars to take roughly 36 months.

Dr Dan Buckland, the senior study author from Duke University School of Medicine, said that on Earth, expired medication was usually less effective, although by how much is unpredictable.

“The risk is that an illness later in a Mars mission would end up with a greater severity than had it occurred earlier in the mission before the medication has expired,” he said.

Buckland and colleagues used a Freedom of Information Act (FoI) request to gather a list of the medications onboard the International Space Station (ISS). While the exact medications that would be taken to Mars are not yet known, Buckland said those on the ISS were likely to make up the bulk of a medical kit for such a mission.

Writing in the journal npj Microgravity, the team revealed how they found terrestrial shelf-life data for 91 of the 106 medications on the 2023 ISS list, with their maximum shelf life dates suggesting 54 of the medications would expire by 36 months, including certain painkillers.

Fourteen of the medications would expire by 24 months, including one advanced life support medication, one anaphylaxis treatment medication, two antibiotics and one antipsychotic.

When each medication’s minimum shelf life was considered, 89 of the 106 medications were found to expire by 36 months.",3,0.7184

t3_1ea4f4l,"From the article: A new study published in the journal [Autism Research](https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.3174) sheds light on the attentional patterns of young autistic children and their relationship with sensory experiences. The researchers found notable connections between “sticky attention” and certain sensory behaviors, such as heightened sensory responsiveness and intense interests. Additionally, the study uncovered a novel attentional pattern dubbed “springy attention,” where autistic children tended to return their gaze to familiar stimuli rather than focusing on new ones.

Prior research has highlighted various atypical attention forms in autism, such as difficulty disengaging from certain stimuli (known as “sticky attention”). Understanding these patterns is vital as they could influence sensory processing, which in turn affects daily activities, social interactions, and overall quality of life.

“Many autistic people have uncommon sensory experiences, and some of these can be quite overwhelming – it takes a lot of extra coping energy to go through the world if you are frequently having distressing and exhausting episodes of sensory overload,” said study author Patrick Dwyer, a research fellow at the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre at Trobe University.

“We also know that many young autistic people show different attention patterns to neurotypical people. Attention differences in autism could also affect learning. If somebody pays attention to different things, they will learn different information from their environment, and this could go on to have cascading effects on ongoing learning and development.”",35,0.5423

>“This pro-angiogenic deoxy ribose sugar is naturally occurring, inexpensive and stable and we have shown it can be delivered from a variety of carrier gels or dressings,\" said Muhammed Yar, an associate professor at COMSATS. \"This makes it an attractive candidate to explore further for treatment of hair loss in men.”

t3_1ea3xxt,"From the article: In some good news for nearly half the world’s men, scientists have found that a naturally occurring sugar in humans and animals could be harnessed as a topical treatment for male pattern baldness. This discovery could deliver a non-invasive, inexpensive and safer alternative to leading treatment minoxidil.

An international team of scientists from the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University Pakistan has found that the organic compound 2-deoxy-D-ribose (2dDR) can stimulate new hair growth, following eight years of research into how this deoxy sugar could assist wound healing. The accidental discovery came about when they saw how hair around wound patches was showing accelerated growth, compared to non-treated areas. They believed it was having a direct impact on ailing hair follicles.

“Male pattern baldness is such a common condition, affecting men all over the world, but at the moment there are only two FDA licensed drugs to treat it,” said Sheila MacNeil, a professor at the University of Sheffield. “Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxy ribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth.”

To test their theory, the [researchers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1370833/full#h7) recreated testosterone-driven hair loss in mice, to mimic male pattern baldness in humans. They were then allocated groups: a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated negative control, a minoxidil-treated positive control, animals treated with 2dDR gel, and another given a gel made up of 2dDR and minoxidil.

Minoxidil, which is sold in topical form as brands Rogaine and Theroxidil, is one of only two FDA-approved hair-loss drugs currently on the market, and it does come with some side effects, such as sensitivity to light and scalp discomfort among the most common adverse reactions. It doesn’t treat receding hairlines, is more effective in people under the age of 40, and should not be used by anyone on blood-pressure medication.",152,0.9189

t3_1ea3hm3,"That's fascinating, 

  
The heading of the study suggests, \"Boosting fruit intake during midlife can ward off late-life blues\", while the topic states \"early in life\". This normally isn't a typo that I would bother paying attention to, but I think it should be noted as it can cause some misunderstanding. 

>\"The authors studied a total of 14 fruits most commonly consumed in Singapore and found that the consumption of most fruits, including oranges, tangerines, bananas, papayas, watermelons, apple and honey melon, was associated with reduced likelihood of depression. The association could possibly be the high levels of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory micronutrients in fruits—such as vitamin C, carotenoids and flavonoids—which have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inhibit inflammatory processes in the body that may affect the development of depression. Consumption of vegetables, on the other hand, was found to have no association with the likelihood of depressive symptoms

I find it a bit odd that it specifically discounted 'vegetables' when attempting to verify if these were nutrients that were specifically lacking in vegetables or not. Here is a guide to flavonoid availability of common vegetables from the USDA: [Microsoft PowerPoint - AICR03\\_VegFlavonoids.ppt (usda.gov)](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Articles/AICR03_VegFlav.pdf)

Concerning carotenoids, I know from memory that these are compounds commonly associated with the edible portion of plants that share a vibrant color. For vegetables this for example would be carrots, bell peppers, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, brocolli, spinach, and others. 

This being the case, could antioxidants and their anti-inflammatory components be the cause of this or is there another reason for fruit being the variable that matters? I'm not very informed of the entire range and differences in the micronutrient content between fruit and vegetables, but I'm under the assumption that they are relatively similar with some exceptions like higher sugar content in fruit over vegetables. 

It seems like more and more studies are coming to the same conclusion that diet plays a major, yet underestimated role in modulating our mental health. \"The evidence is growing: food choice is strongly implicated in mental health risk.\", [Food, Mood, and Brain Health: Implications for the Modern Clinician - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6170050/)",35,0.0516

From the linked article: 

Results

After a mean follow-up of 19.6 years, depressive symptoms were identified among 3,180 participants. Consumption of fruits was inversely associated with the odds of depressive symptoms in a dose-response manner: comparing extreme quartiles, the OR (95% CI) of depressive symptoms was 0.71 (0.63−0.81; P-trend <0.01). Intake of several types of fruits, especially orange, tangerine, banana, papaya and watermelon, was associated with reduced odds, and this inverse association was similar across subgroups of fruits categorized by glycemic index. Conversely, intake of vegetables was not associated with the odds of depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

Our findings support population-based recommendation of having sufficient fruit intake early in life to reduce the likelihood of depressive symptoms in late life.",6,-0.765

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14564

From the linked article: 

A recent study published in Psychophysiology sheds light on the relationship between anxiety and brain function, specifically focusing on how anxiety impacts the cognitive control network of the brain. The findings suggest that major anxiety disorders are associated with decreased activity in certain brain regions, which could serve as neural markers for anxiety symptoms.

Anxiety, characterized by irrational fear and feelings of helplessness, affects millions of people worldwide. While mild anxiety can be beneficial by making individuals more aware of their surroundings, severe anxiety can lead to debilitating conditions known as anxiety disorders. These disorders interfere with daily functioning and are often accompanied by other mental health issues, most commonly depression.

The findings suggest that decreased activity in these brain regions could be a neural marker for major anxiety disorders. The cognitive control network, including the rDLPFC and lFEF, is essential for regulating thoughts and emotions. Impaired function in this network could contribute to symptoms of anxiety, such as an inability to control unrealistic worries. These results align with previous studies that have linked anxiety to cognitive control impairments but provide more precise evidence by isolating anxiety from depression.

This study’s findings highlight the importance of targeting specific brain regions in treatments for anxiety disorders. By understanding the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety, researchers can develop more effective interventions. Future research should include more comprehensive measures of anxiety and depression, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale or the Beck Depression Inventory, to validate these findings.",29,-0.9764

t3_1e9s1zm,"Wouldn't that make sense as people with chronic forms of anxiety *aren't* regulated? Hence less activity in the area associated with regulation?  
  
Side note, this is not a dig at people with anxiety. As someone with a history of trauma, I'm quite familiar with just what it's like to lack that regulation and not even realize it, because *this* (broad gesturing) is all you might've ever known and you only start to realize it through improvement on your relationship toward your own emotions (especially the uncomfortable kind, they have a huge place to fill!). A lot of those skills come from having emotionally *safe*, supportive, mirroring, caring caregivers who support our inner experience and feelings rather than dismiss, minimize, invalidate or avoid them.  
Our culture doesn't help this at all by the way, in fact it actively encourages people to avoid feeling uncomfortable things.  
Extra side note, this isn't just a switch you flick on one day to change your relationship toward your emotions. It takes work and education about how emotions actually work, their role, regulation, improving the window of tolerance, processing, etc... Usually there's a lot of trauma to work through as we never learned how to process and resolve those things, and they're still floating around there in the background.  
Not saying there's a straightforward resolution to this as anxiety has a variety of valid sources and it can be more than just an unhealthy relationship toward emotion, but *we need more education about this side of it* rather than just medicating the *symptom* and wishing people luck.",3,0.8799

Previous research has linked loneliness to a range of health issues, including cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic conditions, as well as overall increased mortality. However, these associations do not account for all the health risks related to loneliness.

The concept of epigenetic aging, where biological age differs from chronological age due to molecular changes in DNA, is a promising area for understanding these risks. [In this study](https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000822), researchers Colin D. Freilich and colleagues investigated whether loneliness is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging and whether this, in turn, impacts chronic health conditions.

The researchers utilized data from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study, a comprehensive, longitudinal study that examines the role of psychological, social, and biological factors in aging. A total of 445 participants (between ages 26-86) who had completed longitudinal follow-ups were included in the analyses.

Loneliness was measured at the initial time point using three self-report items, with participants indicating how much of the time in the past 30 days they felt lonely, close to others, and like they belonged, on a 5-point scale. At two subsequent time points, participants reported any of 30 chronic health conditions they had experienced or been treated for in the past 12 months.",6,-0.7003

From the linked article: 

The sluggish start to the day, the struggle to concentrate on everyday tasks and the lethargy that comes with just a few hours sleep, these are the symptoms that will be familiar to anyone who suffers with insomnia.

But according to research, not all sleepless nights are the same. Brain scans have revealed evidence for distinct forms of insomnia, each with an associated pattern of neural wiring.

And while the clinical distinction may mean little to those whose days are blighted by sleep deprivation, the discovery does raise the prospect of tailored interventions for people with different kinds of insomnia, which could lead to better treatments.

Researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience in Amsterdam analysed MRI scans from more than 200 insomniacs and dozens of sound sleepers and spotted structural changes that distinguished sleepers from the sleepless and five separate forms of insomnia.

“If these subtypes differ in their biological mechanism, then patients in each subtype might benefit from different focused treatments,” said Tom Bresser, a neuroscientist and first author on the study.

In the latest work, published in Biological Psychiatry and led by Prof Eus van Someren, the team looked at MRI brain scans from 204 people with insomnia who had been grouped according to the subtypes. The scans revealed brain structure differences between the subtypes, providing further evidence that they are rooted in biology.",35,0.7876

t3_1ececx4,"Im going to be really shallow and honest and say something here. 

Meeting people IRL at events is a great pitch. I would love to goto a trivia night or game night and meet someone! Unfortunately, I’ve tried this. A lot. And you know what the reality is? Most of the people at these events are the same people I swipe left on on dating apps. I’m a dude, and I have done probably 20+ events to meet people. Ive met upwards of 100+ people, had dinners with strangers, taken pottery classes, gone to board game events, etc. I have met maybe 3 attractive women, 1 of which was engaged, and another of which was either manic or bipolar. 

People keep talking up these events, but look at the people who go. There’s a group in LA called lasocialevents or something and they constantly post things to do and meet people. They also post videos and pictures from the events, and I’ve yet to see a single attractive woman in anything they’ve posted. Don’t get me started on the men. 

The reality is, attractive interesting people don’t need to goto events like this because they meet people other ways. 

So it’s a viscous cycle. You go on dating apps, swipe through a bunch of bad likes from unattractive women, get frustrated you never match with attractive women (because they’re inundated with attention from men - my female friend has 1,100 likes on hinge right now) and then this option comes along but no one you want to meet goes to those either. 

So yeah. If you’re an average looking person who just wants to meet someone, goto trivia events or whatever. But otherwise, they aren’t really worth it",6,0.9824

I am not advocating that voice actors be replaced with ai, but saying you can't use any form of ai voice seems like it would be an unnecessary limitation on developers. Games like balders gate would be amazing if every name you give your character was spoken aloud durring dialog.

I don't binge watch shows. I watch the movie or series once, and that's usually it. It might be 9months to a year before I'm interested in watching again.

$15 a month in say New York is valued less than very rural areas like central US, in my case Oklahoma and Kansas. It might take the average person a fraction of an hour, up to an hour, to make $15. Good on them. Many in rural areas it may take up to 2 hours of work. (After taxes.) Value matters.

Let's not forget signing up for a service, and months later they change the agreements, barely say anything to the users (*but we sent out an email that almost no one looked at!*), and wonder why people are complaining or leaving.

Personally, like many others, if I signed up for a service with understanding and agree to version 1 of the agreement that was out at that moment I clicked agree, I expect that agreement to stay the same while I continue to pay. If that agreement is changed, I should not only have to re-agree to that change, but should not be effective until the renewal of the prior paid agreement ends, and I should not be charged again until I agree to the new changed agreements. *But people will be inconvenienced!* We already are.

t3_1ec25ah,"Some of the pertinent issues:

>On Thursday, researchers from security firm Binarly revealed that Secure Boot is completely compromised on more than 200 device models sold by Acer, Dell, Gigabyte, Intel, and Supermicro. The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what’s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https : //github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000\\_4000.git, and it's not clear when it was taken down.  
>  
>The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot.  
>  
>“It’s a big problem,” said Martin Smolár, a malware analyst specializing in rootkits who reviewed the Binarly research and spoke to me about it. “It’s basically an unlimited Secure Boot bypass for these devices that use this platform key. So until device manufacturers or OEMs provide firmware updates, anyone can basically… execute any malware or untrusted code during system boot. Of course, privileged access is required, but that’s not a problem in many cases.”  
>  
>...  
>  
>The researchers soon discovered that the compromise of the key was just the beginning of a much bigger supply-chain breakdown that raises serious doubts about the integrity of Secure Boot on more than 300 additional device models from virtually all major device manufacturers. As is the case with the platform key compromised in the 2022 GitHub leak, an additional 21 platform keys contain the strings “DO NOT SHIP” or “DO NOT TRUST.”  
>  
>These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren't clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.  
>  
>...  
>  
>There's little that users of an affected device can do other than install a patch if one becomes available from the manufacturer. In the meantime, it's worth remembering that Secure Boot has a history of not living up to its promises. The most recent reminder came late last year with the disclosure of LogoFAIL, a constellation of image-parsing vulnerabilities in UEFI libraries from just about every device maker. By replacing the legitimate logo images with identical-looking ones that have been specially crafted to exploit these bugs, LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute malicious code at the most sensitive stage of the boot process, which is known as DXE, short for Driver Execution Environment.  
>  
>“My takeaway is ‘yup, \\[manufacturers\\] still screw up Secure Boot, this time due to lazy key management,’ but it wasn't obviously a change in how I see the world (secure boot being a fig leaf security measure in many cases),” HD Moore, a firmware security expert and CTO and co-founder at runZero, said after reading the Binarly report. “The story is that the whole UEFI supply chain is a hot mess and hasn't improved much since 2016.”

t3_1ec1lye,"**How robots and AI change the meaningfulness of work**

July 19th was a day for help-desk heroes and support superstars. A routine software update by CrowdStrike, a cyber-security company, caused computer outages in offices, hospitals and airports worldwide. Most white-collar workers looked disconsolately at their screens and realised just how useless they are if they cannot log in. People in IT came to the rescue of helpless colleagues and stranded passengers. Their work that day was full of stress—but also full of meaning.

If machines can add purpose to some jobs when they fail, what about when they work properly? This is not an idle question. Discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) in particular easily get lost in hypothetical debates about wholesale job losses or, worse, the nature of consciousness. But technologies tend to spread in less dramatic ways, task by task rather than role by role. Before machines replace individuals, they change the nature of the work they do.

That is likely to affect job satisfaction. Many employees put a higher premium on non-monetary than monetary rewards. A recent Federal Reserve discussion paper by Katherine Lim and Mike Zabek surveyed American workers who had switched jobs to find out whether and why they thought their new positions were better; they found that interest in the work mattered more to people than pay and benefits.

Which is why another recent paper, from Milena Nikolova and Femke Cnossen of the University of Groningen and Boris Nikolaev of Colorado State University, makes for sobering reading. The authors looked at the prevalence of robots in industrial settings and how that affected workers. Robots reduced the perceived meaningfulness of jobs across the board, irrespective of age, gender, skills and the type of work. In theory, machines can free up time for more interesting tasks; in practice, they seem to have had the opposite effect.

In a separate paper, Ms Nikolova and Ms Cnossen, along with Anthony Lepinteur of the University of Luxembourg, explore why this might be. They find that industrial robots make jobs less physically taxing. But the number of tasks that remain open to humans dwindles, hurting both the variety of work and people’s understanding of the production process. Work becomes more routine, not less.

Machines need not have a dulling effect. In their research Ms Nikolova and her co-authors found that people did not perceive a loss of autonomy if they were working with computers, where they have more control of the machine than the other way round. (Presuming, of course, you can turn it on.) And automation may well have a different impact on service industries like health care, where less time spent on drudge work might indeed mean more time with patients.

A paper from 2011 by Michael Barrett of the University of Cambridge and his co-authors found that the introduction of drug-dispensing robots into hospital pharmacies had disparate effects. Pharmacists felt the quality of their jobs had improved because they had more time for patient counselling. Like the IT administrators rolling back the CrowdStrike update, technicians enjoyed the enhanced status that came with knowing how to fix the robots. Pharmacy assistants had a more miserable time of it, however, as their role shrank to loading medicine into the machines.

Consumer reactions to automation can also vary. An experiment conducted by Eugina Leung, now of Tulane University, and her co-authors tested how customers reacted to different descriptions of a cooking set. People who prided themselves on being skilled chefs really didn’t like products that promised to do everything at the touch of a button. A technology that cuts down on boring tasks is fine; one that threatens your sense of identity is not.

It is still too early to know how AI will affect the quality of work. Some will surely enjoy using a bot to brainstorm ideas and take care of menial tasks. Yet research by Pok Man Tang of the University of Georgia and his co-authors also suggests that workers who interact more with AI assistants feel lonelier and crave more social contact. 

The thing for managers to remember is that machines can make employees feel differently about their work. So it matters whether new technologies are introduced in collaboration with employees or imposed from above, and whether they enhance or sap their sense of competence. Bosses who ignore these issues are missing something meaningful.",10,0.9939

There's a 'split in authority' over what legal precedent should govern the claims, so tossing them out would be premature. It's like a digital version of the Wild West!

Edit: I read the case link and it seems Beijing Meishe Network Technology Co., Ltd. (Meishe) filed a complaint against defendants TikTok Inc., TikTok Pte. Ltd., ByteDance Ltd., and ByteDance Inc.

Meishe alleges that TikTok had access to its source code through a former employee, Mr. Jing Xie, who worked for Meishe until June 2015 and began working for TikTok around October 2017.

>Israel’s New $1.2 Billion Laser Will Be Nearly Unstoppable—And America Wants One, Too

>This air-defense system never runs out of ammunition and can destroy threats up to 4.3 miles away.

>BY  DAVID HAMBLING

>PUBLISHED: JUL 24, 2024

>Israel had defeated virtually the entire attack, swatting cruise missiles, ballistic missiles ,rockets, and drones from the sky. And that was by design.

>“Israel is a narrow strip of land with dense urban population centers. That does not leave much depth, so there is a premium on intercepting threats in flight,” explains James Black, assistant director at RAND Europe, a nonprofit think tank. But Israel’s sophisticated, multi-layered integrated air-defense systems couldn’t stop everything. Nine Iranian missiles reportedly struck Nevatim and Ramon Airbases, and one person was injured by shrapnel. The waves of drones, missiles, and rockets synchronized to hit simultaneously were meant to overload Israeli defenses and exhaust stocks of interceptors. The wall held well this time, but Israeli planners know it’s a numbers game.

>“Looking at both Israel and Ukraine, we are seeing defenders burning through missiles faster than industry can replace them,” Black says. So, Israel wants an air-defense system that never runs out of ammunition: Iron Beam.

>A $1.2 billion U.S. aid package will help fund deployment of Iron Beam, Israel’s one-of-a-kind, high-power laser system designed to knock down missiles, rockets, and drones. It’s a big bet on unproven technology—but success would yield an almost invincible defensive shield. Assuming all goes to plan, Iron Beam will be a lifesaver for the Israelis, who suffer regular aerial attacks. Yemen’s Houthi Rebels alone have lobbed more than 220 kamikaze drones and missiles at Israel since the war with Hamas broke out in October 2023. And then there is Iran and Hezbollah, of course. As weapons proliferate and ranges increase, America could one day face the same problem—but lasers could solve that issue at the speed of light.

>OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS “SHIELD OF LIGHT,” Iron Beam is a 100 kilowatt-class High-Energy Laser Weapon System, which Rafael Advanced Defense Systems first unveiled in2014. Rafael is also a contractor on Iron Dome. “Iron Beam will not replace Iron Dome, but complement it. Directed Energy offers a way to prioritize kinetic interceptors against the threats they are most needed for,” Black says. Specifically, Iron Beam will be integrated as an additional short-range layer to destroy threats up to 4.3 miles away.

>Unlike missiles, Iron Beam can keep firing as long as it has power.

>“Much of the interest in lasers stems from the magazine depth they offer,” Black says.“ This is not quite infinite—parts and energy supplies do not last forever—but they do give a very deep magazine compared to batteries of missiles.”

>Another important aspect is the cost per intercept. One Iron Dome interceptor missile costs $40,000–$50,000, according to Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. While cruise missiles can run to millions of dollars, Iran’s long-range Shahed-136 drones are simple, low-tech machines costing less than $30,000 apiece. Hamas mainly relies on Qassam home-made rockets, assembled from industrial pipes and improvised explosives, costing less than $1,000 each.",86,-0.9467

Israel isn't the only state working on laser system: the UK had began testing similar system in the last few months; the US navy had been experimenting with lasers for years now.

It seems likely that Israel's system will be the first to see combat, for the simple reason that Israel is under constant attack by terrorists using cheap, small UAVs.

Ukraine could also use such a system; however, Ukraine is much larger than Israel, and the short-range nature of laser systems will require a huge number of units (same problem with their use of an Iron Dome or similar system).",286,-0.8834

t3_1eby6xp,"Vice President Kamala Harris has long been the target of racist and misogynistic attacks online as a woman in politics who is also Black and South Asian. As she seeks the Democratic nomination for president, the gendered, sexualized and racial disinformation against her could get worse — and experts warn there may be less comprehensive oversight by tech companies to stop its spread this election cycle.

In the days since President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris to be his successor, right-wing media personalities and others have posted disinformation and misinformation — intentional and unintentional spreading of false information, respectively — about Harris in memes, videos and writings online.

The posts, shared on popular social media platforms, have primarily focused on sexualized and racist narratives about Harris, including claims about her dating history and her eligibility to be president. Disinformation experts who spoke with The 19th said highlighting or linking to more specific disinformation about Harris risks amplifying it.

On Instagram, which is owned by Meta, at least one account shared several memes about Harris that implied a sexual narrative about her. The company, which has a plan for online manipulations around elections, later removed the content. Manipulated audio of Harris also quickly circulated on TikTok at the start of the week and was shared hundreds of thousands of times before TikTok removed the audio, which falsely shows Harris slurring remarks. A representative for the platform told the progressive research group Media Matters for America that it is “actively and aggressively removing this content.”

Jankowicz pointed out that many of the altered images and memes being shared about Harris are not AI generated, but instead “cheap fakes” — in other words, content that is created with easy-to-access software or other simple means that also makes it more difficult to detect sometimes. She worries that the sustained online attacks against Harris and other elected women will lead some who are considering politics to give up on running for office in the future — a difficult-to-track ripple effect that could ensure politics remain heavily male and White.",-2,-0.8495

- The first place to ever *fire* me imploded. Then the manager that fired me stole some intellectual property and went to that company's direct competitor to be never heard from again.
- Second place to fire me also imploded. It was full of a bunch of engineers who wanted to build a real product, lead by engineers who just wanted to tinker, all bitching about the sales & marketing teams who operated independently of technical input. They've since rebranded, and are still desparate to hire a new robotics engineering team... Especially since they're not making any money and don't have anyone to build new products, let alone maintain their existing fleets.
- Third place to fire me was a $2bln company whose CEO / Board President (depending on the week) was basically caught violating ITAR among other investment frauds, fled the country, and now that business no longer has operations in the U.S.
- Fourth place to fire me was a small startup where the CEO got lucky as an undergrad and had no idea how to actually build a product, manage customer expectations, and manage a business. Oh, and though he'd frequently state that he doesn't want anyone to be afraid of making mistakes, never hesitated for a moment to shitcan anyone who *he thought* wasn't performing. I laughed both times he went behind my back, fired my team, found out that he fucked all of us in his ignorance, and rehired each of them as contractors for double what he was paying as direct employees.
- Fifth place to fire me didn't give me any real support, the software was insanely complex all due to political reasons, and responded to any \"tall poppies\" by swiftly firing them before their own ineptitude is known outside of the team.
- Not so much a firing as a contract being suspended... The client's executive team can't make up their minds, so they asked my bosses if they could furlough me for four months.

The places that didn't cut me were all across the spectrum. One really awesome, one not so much, and one that I didn't feel like I fit in at all. But one fact always remained:

And the disappearance of control knobs has been a disgrace. Now instead of turning a dial to control functions, you have to use clunky and shitty UI touch screens or at best, directional switches.

It's also very valuable to ad-pushers, who will be able to target drivers with geo-located ads.
* OTA firmware updates: do you know what's the best way to keep a computer secure? that's right, keep it off the Internet. Once a computer (your PC, a server, your car's engine-management system) is connected to the Internet, criminals and bored script kiddies will keep poking it for security holes *and find them*.
* There's an additional reason, barely mentioned but which makes car-makers drool with greed: subscription services. You want to make a bean-counter cum? whisper in his ear \"recurring revenue stream\".
