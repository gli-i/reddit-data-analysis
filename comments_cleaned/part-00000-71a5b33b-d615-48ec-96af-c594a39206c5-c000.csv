t3_1ectdb6,"Academic paper [here.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.124.047643)

“New research led by UCLA Health has found that specific genes may be related to the trajectory of recovery for stroke survivors, providing doctors insights useful for developing targeted therapies.

Published in the journal Stroke this month, the findings were part of an exploratory study that sought to find if candidate genes could predict a higher likelihood of stroke outcomes related to depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive decline.

Dr. Steven C. Cramer, MD, the study’s lead author and a professor of neurology at UCLA, said while there are some predictors physicians can use to anticipate stroke recovery, such as a patient’s age or baseline health, they only tell part of the story.

“In the big picture, the issue that we face is that, when somebody has a stroke, it’s hard to anticipate what’s going to come next,” said Cramer. “People look up to us from the gurney in the ER and say, ‘What’s next? What’s going to happen to me?’ People want to understand what their trajectory will be, people want to have a sense of how well going to be, or not, and what treatments are available to them.”

Similarly, clinicians who treat patients with stroke need improved methods to understand how a patient will fare in order to develop a personalized medicine approach for each individual, Cramer said.

Past studies have provided evidence that genetic differences are related the process of stroke recovery, but there has been limited study on the specific outcomes with which these genes are associated. For example, most previous genetic studies related to stroke have relied on the modified Rankin scale, which is a measure of global disability that combines recovery data across all behaviors into one single-digit score.

However, Cramer said this scoring system does not account for the granular differences in stroke outcomes for patients, such as a patient having improved movement but continued severe depression, or having persistent anxiety but showing good recovering of arm movement. As a result, Dr. Cramer, in collaboration with Dr. E. Alison Holman at UC Irvine, sought to determine whether there was a method to more precisely measure the various behavioral outcomes among stroke survivors.

To do this, Cramer and his team measured details for a group of candidate genes to examine in more than 700 patients enrolled throughout the U.S. Additionally, researchers conducted detailed behavioral assessments of the participants’ cognitive health, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and other deficits for one year after the stroke.

The study found significant associations between certain genes and these behavioral health outcomes. Specifically, the rs6265 gene variant was associated with poorer cognition. This gene variant is related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which is the most common growth factor in the brain and is strongly associated with learning. About 20-30% of people are estimated to have this genetic variant, which slows the release of BDNF.

“Your brain gushes out BDNF when you’re learning new things,” Cramer said. “Hopefully your brain is gushing out BDNF at this very moment. People who have this gene variant had poorer cognitive status at one year.”

Environmental factors, such as stressors, also played a role in genetic expression among stroke patients. Patients with the gene variants rs4291 and rs324420 were at higher risk for developing more severe depression and PTSD symptoms after one-year post-stroke.

“The more stress they reported, the more the gene variant was associated with poorer outcomes,” Cramer said.

Another variant, rs4680 was linked to lower depression and PTSD symptoms.

While the results still require independent verification, Cramer said these insights could help physicians and other allied health professionals tailor treatment options for patients based on a simple genetic test.

“If these discoveries are validated as accurate, you could look at someone on the day they have their stroke and say, ‘I know that on average you are at higher risk of a poorer outcome regarding cognitive function a year from now,’” Cramer said. “Maybe those are the people that need extra cognitive rehab or maybe one day we’ll have a drug that targets certain gene receptors. The idea is that you could divide people into different groups and use that knowledge not just for prediction but hopefully one day for improved, individualized treatment.”",1,-0.9847

t3_1ect3fk,"Academic paper [here.](https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awae153/7714669)

“An experimental drug originally developed to treat cancer may help clear HIV from infected cells in the brain, according to a new Tulane University study.

For the first time, researchers at Tulane National Primate Research Center found that a cancer drug significantly reduced levels of SIV, the nonhuman primate equivalent of HIV, in the brain by targeting and depleting certain immune cells that harbor the virus.

Published in the journal Brain, this discovery marks a significant step toward eliminating HIV from hard-to-reach reservoirs where the virus evades otherwise effective treatment.

“This research is an important step in tackling brain-related issues caused by HIV, which still affect people even when they are on effective HIV medication,” said lead study author Woong-Ki Kim, PhD, associate director for research at Tulane National Primate Research Center. “By specifically targeting the infected cells in the brain, we may be able to clear the virus from these hidden areas, which has been a major challenge in HIV treatment.”

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an essential component of successful HIV treatment, maintaining the virus at undetectable levels in the blood and transforming HIV from a terminal illness into a manageable condition. However, ART does not completely eradicate HIV, necessitating lifelong treatment. The virus persists in “viral reservoirs” in the brain, liver, and lymph nodes, where it remains out of reach of ART.

The brain has been a particularly challenging area for treatment due to the blood-brain barrier — a protective membrane that shields it from harmful substances but also blocks treatments, allowing the virus to persist. In addition, cells in the brain known as macrophages are extremely long-lived, making them difficult to eradicate once they become infected.

Infection of macrophages is thought to contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction, experienced by nearly half of those living with HIV. Eradicating the virus from the brain is critical for comprehensive HIV treatment and could significantly improve the quality of life for those with HIV-related neurocognitive problems.

Researchers focused on macrophages, a type of white blood cell that harbors HIV in the brain. By using a small molecule inhibitor to block a receptor that increases in HIV-infected macrophages, the team successfully reduced the viral load in the brain. This approach essentially cleared the virus from brain tissue, providing a potential new treatment avenue for HIV.

The small molecule inhibitor used, BLZ945, has previously been studied for therapeutic use in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and brain cancer, but never before in the context of clearing HIV from the brain.

The study, which took place at the Tulane National Primate Research Center, utilized three groups to model human HIV infection and treatment: an untreated control group, and two groups treated with either a low or high dose of the small molecule inhibitor for 30 days. The high-dose treatment lead to a notable reduction in cells expressing HIV receptor sites, as well as a 95-99% decrease in viral DNA loads in the brain .

In addition to reducing viral loads, the treatment did not significantly impact microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, which are essential for maintaining a healthy neuroimmune environment. It also did not show signs of liver toxicity at the doses tested.

The next step for the research team is to test this therapy in conjunction with ART to assess its efficacy in a combined treatment approach. This could pave the way for more comprehensive strategies to eradicate HIV from the body entirely.

This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, including grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and was supported with resources from the Tulane National Primate Research Center base grant of the National Institutes of Health, P51 OD011104.”",3,0.3284

In a study published in [Telematics and Informatics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2024.102159), researchers recently investigated this tricky question, exploring how people manage self-presentation on dates when they have to reveal both negative and positive traits. The findings indicate that women more often disclosed morally disgusting behaviors and artistic abilities, while men tended to reveal pathogenically disgusting behaviors and kindness.

The researchers were motivated by a desire to understand how individuals manage the delicate balance of self-presentation in dating contexts, especially when it involves revealing both positive and negative traits. While extensive research has been conducted on the traits people prefer in potential partners, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding how people choose to disclose their own less desirable qualities. The study aimed to fill this gap by examining which traits individuals prefer to highlight or conceal when trying to make a favorable impression on a date.

Another key motivation was to explore the role of different types of disgust in shaping these self-presentation choices. Disgust, being a fundamental factor influencing social and romantic interactions, can significantly impact one’s image in the eyes of a potential partner. By focusing on three specific types of disgust—pathogen, sexual, and moral—the researchers hoped to uncover patterns in how these different forms of disgust affect dating dynamics.",19,0.93

Memes are pieces of media that are “passed very quickly from one internet user to another, often with slight changes that make them humorous.” One reason for their popularity is their ability to communicate about controversial and taboo topics humorously, typically by individuals who are not affected by the topic.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. Children with ADHD often struggle with maintaining focus, following through on tasks, and controlling their impulses. These symptoms can significantly impact academic performance, social interactions, and daily activities. ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders in children, but it also affects adults.

Object recognition memory refers to the ability to recognize previously encountered objects and distinguish them from new ones. This type of memory is an important component of declarative memory, which encompasses facts and events that can be consciously recalled. Object recognition memory involves two primary processes: familiarity discrimination, which allows one to recognize something as familiar, and recollection, which involves retrieving details about the encounter

https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20241039

From the linked article: 

The recognition of same-sex marriage across the European Union has had a negative impact on the US economy, causing the number of highly skilled foreign workers seeking visas to drop by about 21%, according to a new study.

The list of countries that legally perform and recognize same-sex marriage now stands at 36 and continues to grow. Despite fears that same-sex marriage would undermine the institution of different-sex marriage, research has shown that, after 20 years, those fears were unfounded. Indeed, same-sex marriage has consistently been found to be positive for couples, their children, and the general population.

Now, a new study by researchers from Washington State University (WSU) has found that marriage equality also has a major economic benefit.

“This [study] just shows that having more inclusive policies can make a country more attractive for skilled labor,” said Koroles Awad, a PhD candidate in economics at WSU and the study’s lead author.

“In general, discriminatory policies are bad for the economy, and this is one way that shows it,” said Jill McCluskey, a WSU economics professor and the study’s co-author. “As a country, we should try to have all the people be able to fulfill their potential. If we have policies that are non-discriminatory, then everyone can do better, and it will be better for the country.”",64,0.9332

https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00399-0

From the linked article: 

MIT scientists have discovered an intriguing new way to produce hydrogen fuel, using just soda cans, seawater and coffee grounds. The team says the chemical reaction could be put to work powering engines or fuel cells in marine vehicles that suck in seawater.

In tests, a single pellet of aluminum weighing just 0.3 g (0.01 oz) placed in fresh, de-ionized water produced 400 ml of hydrogen in just five minutes. Scaled up, the team estimates that a single gram of pellets could generate an astonishing 1.3 L (0.3 gal) of hydrogen in five minutes.

The researchers propose that their recipe forms the basis of a practical hydrogen reactor that could be especially useful for powering marine vehicles.

“This is very interesting for maritime applications like boats or underwater vehicles because you wouldn’t have to carry around seawater – it’s readily available,” said Aly Kombargi, lead author of the study. “We also don’t have to carry a tank of hydrogen. Instead, we would transport aluminum as the ‘fuel,’ and just add water to produce the hydrogen that we need.”",7,0.8685
t3_1eci97i,"I love how this title names it “soda cans” instead of “aluminum.”  It takes enormous amounts of energy to produce metals in their pure state.  Allowing them to react will indeed get some energy back.  We COULD, for example, simply burn iron filings to produce rust, then use solar energy to electro-isolate the iron again.

Link to the journal article [Cdk8/CDK19 promotes mitochondrial fission through Drp1 phosphorylation and can phenotypically suppress pink1 deficiency in Drosophila](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47623-8)

Abstract:

>Cdk8 in Drosophila is the orthologue of vertebrate CDK8 and CDK19. These proteins have been shown to modulate transcriptional control by RNA polymerase II. We found that neuronal loss of Cdk8 severely reduces fly lifespan and causes bang sensitivity. Remarkably, these defects can be rescued by expression of human CDK19, found in the cytoplasm of neurons, suggesting a non-nuclear function of CDK19/Cdk8. Here we show that Cdk8 plays a critical role in the cytoplasm, with its loss causing elongated mitochondria in both muscles and neurons. We find that endogenous GFP-tagged Cdk8 can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. We show that Cdk8 promotes the phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616, a protein required for mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, Pink1, a mitochondrial kinase implicated in Parkinson’s disease, also phosphorylates Drp1 at the same residue. Indeed, overexpression of Cdk8 significantly suppresses the phenotypes observed in flies with low levels of Pink1, including elevated levels of ROS, mitochondrial dysmorphology, and behavioral defects. In summary, we propose that Pink1 and Cdk8 perform similar functions to promote Drp1-mediated fission.",23,0.8971

t3_1ec43k2,"From the Llama 3.1 405B paper. (Training with synthetic data).

Synthetic data generation: execution feedback. The 8B and 70B models show significant performance
improvements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial
experiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can
even degrade performance). 

To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of truth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large dataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:

• Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem
descriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To
achieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model to generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide range of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).

• Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming
language. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the
generated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought
process in comments.

• Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is
not guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model’s
quality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. 

To achieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of
static and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:

– Static analysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic
correctness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported
functions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.

– Unit test generation and execution: For each problem and solution, we prompt the model
to generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution,
catching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.

• Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the
model to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution,
and feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). 

After a unit test execution failure, the model could either fix the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit tests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the final dataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions were initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution
feedback and improved its performance.

• Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds, with each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating higher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive
refinement and enhancement of the model’s performance.


2. Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between
major programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This
is not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate
this, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to
less common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). 

This is achieved by prompting Llama 3 and ensuring quality via syntax parsing, compilation, and execution. Figure 8 demonstrates an example of synthetic PHP code translated from Python. This improves performance significantly for less common languages as measured by the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark.


3. Synthetic data generation: backtranslation. To improve certain coding capabilities (e.g., documentation, explanations) where execution feedback is less informative for determining quality, we employ an alternative multi-step approach. Using this procedure, we generated approximately 1.2M synthetic...",37,0.9514

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.13007

From the linked article: 

Over the last few decades, America has witnessed a substantial decline in religiosity. Although the United States remains relatively religious compared to other nations, it is markedly less religious today than it was thirty years ago. However, a recent study published in Advances in Political Psychology uncovers an important nuance: secularism is distinct from mere nonreligiosity. The findings reveal that secularists form a unique group within the American electorate, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of secular trends is essential for grasping contemporary political dynamics.

While the increase in nonreligiosity, often termed “the rise of the nones,” has been widely documented, the new study sought to delve deeper into the distinctions between secularism and nonreligiosity. By doing so, the researchers aimed to clarify the political implications of these trends and how they might shape the future of American politics.

The study’s findings provide evidence that secularism is not simply the absence of religion but a distinctive identity characterized by specific beliefs and orientations. Unlike nonreligiosity, which denotes a lack of religious affiliation or belief, secularism involves an active identification with principles grounded in empirical evidence and rational thought. Secularists, therefore, are defined by what they believe in rather than what they lack.

For instance, secularists exhibited strong opposition to conspiracy theories. The researchers found that secularists are less likely to believe in various conspiracy theories compared to nonreligious individuals. This skepticism towards conspiracy theories is consistent with secularists’ reliance on empirical evidence and rational thought.

By contrast, nonreligiosity did not show a consistent relationship with opposition to conspiracy theories. This highlights the importance of the affirmative secular identity, which actively seeks evidence-based explanations and rejects unsubstantiated claims.

One of the most significant findings of the study is the strong association between secularism and liberal political attitudes. Secularists are more likely to support Democratic candidates and align with liberal policies compared to their nonreligious counterparts. This tendency is evident across various policy areas, including social welfare, environmental protection, and immigration.

The study also reveals that secularists are staunch supporters of core democratic values. Secularists exhibit strong support for participatory democracy, advocating for the inclusion of all individuals in the political process and the removal of barriers to voting. They also emphasize the importance of freedom of expression, opposing censorship and supporting the right to express even unpopular or controversial ideas.

Interestingly, the researchers found that liberals, particularly those identifying as very liberal, are generally unsupportive of allowing disliked groups such as “MAGA supporters,” “racists,” or “Muslim extremists” to hold rallies, teach, or have their books in local libraries. On the other hand, secularists, despite having similar disliked groups, are more likely than nonsecularists to extend civil liberties to these groups, demonstrating a higher level of political tolerance.",260,0.9894

First it just seems like we're talking about non religious people (aka atheists), but then it specifically says this is different to non-religious people (but I don't think it adequately explains why it's different) and otherwise seems to argue that this is a wider philosophical perspective about evidence based arguments, and then it starts contrasting versus 'liberals'?


So is a secularist just someone that (at the very least) thinks that their positions are based on empirical evidence over religious/spiritual evidence?

How would you do that ethically?  The “placebo” arm would not just be not given the vaccine under trial (against Alzheimer’s) but would unambiguously not be given the approved, trialled shingles vaccine.  If there is another equally effective and tolerated shingles vaccine that could be used as a control that might work,  it would complicate the trial: maybe it too is protective against dementia, which would make both look ineffective?

t3_1ebzoeo,"New evidence indicates that the new shingles vaccine is more protective against dementia compared to the previous shingles vaccine, which was also reported to reduce dementia rates. It is also more protective than vaccines against other infections.

The study of more than 200,000 people by researchers at the University of Oxford funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre (OH BRC) found at least a 17% reduction in dementia diagnoses in the six years after the new recombinant shingles vaccination, equating to 164 or more additional days lived without dementia.

The findings suggest that the recombinant shingles vaccine may have additional value in terms of protection against dementia. Further research is needed to confirm this, and to identify how and why the vaccine has this effect.

Shingles is a painful and serious condition afflicting many elderly people. It is caused by the Herpes zoster virus that can flare up in people who previously had chicken pox. After the introduction of a vaccine against shingles (Zostavax) in 2006, several studies have suggested that the risk of dementia might be lower in people who had received the vaccine, although results were not conclusive. In many countries, including the UK and USA, Zostavax has now been withdrawn and replaced by a much more effective vaccine (Shingrix). In the UK, Shingrix is being offered by the NHS to all elderly people and certain other groups.

The collaborative project carried out by the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Oulu showed the prevalence of early-onset dementia (EOD) among working-age people by reviewing 12,490 patient records from Kuopio and Oulu University Hospitals between 2010 and 2021.

The study concluded that the incidence of Alzheimer's disease almost doubled among the working-age Finns over the 12-year follow-up period, while the incidence of other forms of EOD remained stable, the national broadcaster Yle reported.

According to findings in the population aged 65, the crude incidence of EOD was 12.3 out of 100,000 people based on 794 new cases from Jan. 1, 2010, to Dec. 31, 2021.

Incidence rates for EOD were 20.5 and 33.7 per 100,000 people in the age groups of 30-64 and 45-64, respectively.

The prevalence of EOD was 110.4 in the age group of 30–64 and 190.3 in 45-64 age group.

The study found that Alzheimer's disease which stood at 48.2% and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia at 12.7% were the most frequent subtypes of dementia.

t3_1ebx322,"From the article: Indiana University School of Medicine researchers have made a significant breakthrough in developing a new gene therapy approach that restores full-length dystrophin protein, which could lead to new treatments for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

The study, recently published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50569-6), demonstrates the effectiveness of their novel gene therapy technology in improving muscle tissue and overall strength in mice models with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in a lack of the protein dystrophin. This deficiency leads to progressive muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue over time. Patients with the disease experience impaired mobility, heart and lung problems, and ultimately a shortened life expectancy.

“Current gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy utilizes a truncated version of dystrophin,” said Renzhi Han, PhD, senior author of the study and professor of pediatrics at the IU School of Medicine. “Unfortunately, this option doesn’t fully protect the muscles because it lacks many important functional domains of full-length dystrophin.\"

While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved a micro-dystrophin gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Han said the therapeutic outcomes have been less satisfactory than expected.",4,0.802

\"Domestic abuse encompasses a range of damaging behaviors beyond physical violence, including economic and emotional abuse. We analyze the impact of cohabiting with an abusive partner on victims’ economic outcomes. In so doing, we highlight the systematic role of economic suppression in such relationships. Using Finnish administrative data and a matched control event study design, along with a within-individual comparison of outcomes across relationships, we document three new facts. First, women who begin relationships with (eventually) physically abusive men suffer large and significant earnings and employment falls immediately upon cohabiting with the abusive partner. Second, the decline in economic outcomes is non-monotonic in women’s pre-cohabitation outside options. Third, men who are violent against women in any capacity impose economic costs on all their female partners, even those who do not report physical violence. To rationalize these findings, we develop a new dynamic model of abusive relationships where women do not perfectly observe their partner’s type, and abusive men have an incentive to use economic suppression to sabotage women’s outside options and their ability to later exit the relationship.\"",15,-0.9939

Now, a study published in [Current Biology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.06.009) on Monday reports that chimpanzees follow a similar communication pattern structured around back-and-forth, fast-paced turns—albeit with gestures rather than speaking.

“Human conversation follows very strict rules of turn-taking that are consistent across cultures and languages,” Gal Badihi, an animal behavior researcher at the University of St Andrews in Scotland and first author of the study, tells the Guardian’s Tanya Procyshyn. “We started to wonder whether chimpanzee communication was governed by its own rules, or if the rules are similar to human conversation.”

Chimpanzee gestures are largely meant to convey requests, with “groom me,” “follow me,” “give me” or “stop it” being common commands. The researchers witnessed a variety of gestured interactions, such as chimps asking to change spots during grooming sessions. Once, a chimp named Ursus gave a reassuring tap to a chimp named Monica when she reached her hand out after a quarrel. In another instance, a male chimp repeatedly made “go away” gestures as a female asked for some meat from an antelope he had killed.

To explore patterns in this communication, the team of scientists collected footage of 8,559 gestures from 252 individuals in five chimp communities in eastern Africa, assembling the largest dataset of chimpanzee conversations ever made. They found that 14 percent of the recorded interactions included at least one response to a gesture, while some included as many as seven back-and-forth responses.

Then, the researchers timed the turns within conversations—in other words, they measured how long it took chimps to respond to each other. Chimps took an average of 120 milliseconds to reply with a gesture, which is not all that dissimilar from the human average of 200 milliseconds.",7,-0.1027

‘Miracle’ new anti-HIV jab could revolutionise virus prevention

Lenacapavir performed so well in clinical trials that researchers stopped the controlled test early

A “miracle” new anti-HIV jab giving protection from the deadly virus for six months is being hailed as a chance to revolutionise prevention of an infection which still kills one person every minute.

A large clinical trial spanning South Africa and Uganda has now shown Lenacapavir injections provided total protection in young African women for six months at a time. In contrast, the same trial found around two per cent of a group taking daily prevention pills catching HIV from partners.

The results could potentially revolutionise prevention.

High risk groups, such as young women, young gay men and injecting drug users could be given this new long-lasting PrEP jab and then allowed to carry on with their lives, only needing to have another shot twice a year.

Protection given by the antiviral drug is so strong and so long lasting that some have described it as “vaccine-like” in its potential.

Preliminary results from the trial attracted excitement in June. The full results of the trial have now been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The trial found Lenacapavir was so effective that not one of the 2,134 women given the drug became infected. The results were so clear cut that researchers stopped the trial early.",85,0.9367

t3_1ebqumd,"Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), nicknamed ‘forever chemicals,’ pose a growing environmental and health threat. Since the invention of Teflon in 1938, PFASs and perfluorinated polymers or PFs have been widely used for their exceptional stability and resistance to water and heat. These properties made them ideal for countless applications, from cookware and clothing to firefighting foam. However, this very stability has become a major problem. PFASs do not easily break down in the environment, leading to their accumulation in water, soil, and even the bodies of humans, where they are known to cause carcinogenic effects and hormonal disruptions. Today, these chemicals can be found in drinking water supplies, food, and even in the soil of Antarctica. Although there are plans to phase out PFAS production, treating them remains challenging as they decompose only at temperatures exceeding 400 °C. As a result, certain amounts of products containing PFASs and PFs end up in landfills, potentially creating future contamination risks.

Now, a room-temperature defluorination method proposed by researchers at Ritsumeikan University could revolutionize PFAS treatment. Their study, published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International EditionNew window on 19 June 2024, details a photocatalytic method that uses visible light to break down PFAS and other fluorinated polymers (FPs) at room temperature into fluorine ions. Using this method, the researchers achieved 100% defluorination of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) within just 8 hours of light exposure.

t3_1ebo6i2,I think I remember a study like this before.

As such the industrials in France used the opportunity to export wine by financing studies to \"prove\" alcohol and especially wine protect the health. It has been debunked for 10-15 years now, I think ...

It shows that science need more safeguards to prevent being manipulated for monetary or political gains. It happened in France this time but it certainly happens everywhere in the world. Also, people's health is more important than money or a tiny bit of glory by having some miraculous red wine. To hell if it hurts our exports, this should be known more.

t3_1ebo6i2,"I’ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: 

https://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsad.23-00283

From the linked article: 

For the regular boozer it is a source of great comfort: the fat pile of studies that say a daily tipple is better for a longer life than avoiding alcohol completely.

But a new analysis challenges the thinking and blames the rosy message on flawed research that compares drinkers with people who are sick and sober.

Scientists in Canada delved into 107 published studies on people’s drinking habits and how long they lived. In most cases, they found that drinkers were compared with people who abstained or consumed very little alcohol, without taking into account that some had cut down or quit through ill health.

The finding means that amid the abstainers and occasional drinkers are a significant number of sick people, bringing the group’s average health down, and making light to moderate drinkers look better off in comparison.

“It’s been a propaganda coup for the alcohol industry to propose that moderate use of their product lengthens people’s lives,” said Dr Tim Stockwell, first author on the study and a scientist at the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research at the University of Victoria.

“The idea has impacted national drinking guidelines, estimates of alcohol’s burden of disease worldwide and has been an impediment to effective policymaking on alcohol and public health,” he added. Details are published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.",621,-0.8641

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222429241256570

From the linked article: 

Researchers from North Carolina State University, University of Manitoba, Bern University of Applied Sciences, University of South Carolina, and California Baptist University published a new Journal of Marketing study that explores whether the onset of daylight saving time leads consumers to engage in unhealthy behaviors.

Changing clocks twice a year is a tradition for most people living in the United States, with the spring transition to daylight saving time raising the ire of many due to the loss of an hour of sleep.

This new Journal of Marketing study explores whether the onset of daylight saving time leads consumers to engage in unhealthy behaviors. The researchers examine social media data from X (formerly Twitter) to study consumer responses to the onset of daylight saving time. They say that “the number of tweets with keywords related to the disruptive nature of the switch to daylight saving time peaked around 12 hours after the change occurred. We also find that the volume of negatively toned tweets rose more substantially, indicating a stronger increase in negative sentiment toward the time change. Overall, our preliminary findings suggests that consumers respond negatively to the switch to daylight saving time.”

Results show that:

- calorie consumption from largely unhealthy snacks increases following the time change and

- visits to fitness centers decrease.

The effect on calorie consumption is amplified during the evening hours and for cloudy days. Further, visits to fitness centers are reduced among fitness center members who live farther away and who do not visit the fitness centers regularly. Finally, the researchers examine the effect of the transition from daylight saving time to standard time (during fall) and find that there is no effect of the fall transition on calories consumed from unhealthy snacks. These results highlight the role of sleepiness caused by the one-hour setback, which impairs consumers’ self-control and leads to less healthy consumption behavior.",5,0.3427

t3_1ebdw0n,"Basically -very poor people live in areas that will be/are affected by climate change and also have more child marriages. The more vulnerable women are the more likely they are to be used as a commodity. 





Conclusions
This work has contributed by econometrically unveiling the channels through which climate change operates on a county´s rate of child marriages using cross sectional analyses with a sample of up to 208 countries. The effect of climate change vulnerability on child marriage have been elucidated using structural equations models (SEM) and controlling by economic and social aspects.

The principal findings are related to a high correlation between climate change vulnerability and child marriage. They elucidate the high negative correlation between a country´s high vulnerability to climate change and some of its most relevant not only economic, but also socioeconomic indicators, such as income and extreme poverty. Additionally, we also elucidate the high correlation of a country´s rate of child marriages with its rate of gender inequality and its income level, which is in line with the results of other studies (Hotchkiss et al., 2016).

Furthermore, the effect of climate change vulnerability exhibits a double channel incidence on child marriage. On the one hand, it indirectly affects child marriage through a channel which would operate because vulnerable countries are more prone to climatic and natural disasters, which as the literature shows, affects the poorest among the poor and the unprotected women and children (Alston et al., 2014; Bhadwal et al., 2019; Kumala Dewi & Dartanto, 2019; Ziegler et al., 2019). On the other hand, if climate change is already occurring -as most of the scientific literature shows- vulnerable countries are, and will be, more affected than non-vulnerable countries.Footnote5

Thereby we have shown here that child marriage is a complex issue, which have several dimensions of different natures and, therefore, should be addressed from different perspectives, such as the reduction of extreme poverty and of poor segments of the population, on the one hand, and the rise of countries’ general income level in developing countries, on the other hand. Moreover, at the same time, it is paramount to insist in promoting more strict laws and norms which prevent child marriage and include women in the educational system because of the existing evidence relating child marriage with the access to education for women (Hotchkiss et al., 2016; Male & Wodon, 2018; Subramanian, 2008; Wodon, 2018). Furthermore, the impulse of public and private policies against gender inequality and inequity is crucial to achieve a cultural change in terms of the role of women and the elimination of gender discrimination.",3,-0.9743

> Results Patients were twice as more often heavy alcohol users compared with controls (13.7% vs 6.7%, p<0.001), were more likely to have hypertension and they were more often current smokers, overweight and physically inactive. In the entire study population, heavy alcohol consumption was independently associated with CIS (adjusted OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.22 to 3.63). In sex-specific analysis, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with CIS in men (2.72; 95% CI 1.25 to 5.92), but not in women (1.56; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.41). When exploring the association with binge drinking alone, a significant association was shown in the entire cohort (2.43; 95% CI 1.31 to 4.53) and in men (3.36; 95% CI 1.44 to 7.84), but not in women.

> Conclusions Heavy alcohol consumption, particularly binge drinking, appears to be an independent risk factor in young men with CIS.

Not doubting it but they haven’t convinced me on *independent* risk factor. I’m glad the concluded ‘appears to be’ an independent risk factor. 

It’s hard to tell but have they controlled for all variables? weight, smoking, cocaine use, ldl, triglycerides. These all seem to be factors more likely to correlate directly with incidence that are indirectly influenced by alcohol. 

Also what is the population incidence of CIS in this demographic? I assume it would be very small while the relative prevalence of alcohol excess and binge drinking would be comparatively much higher in certain populations where alcohol is freely available and culturally acceptable. Or in a more prohibitive culture both sample sizes would be small

Also self reported measure, risk of reporting bias or higher risk of social desirability bias among control group",13,0.5878

t3_1ebbcfn,The main issue with weight loss isn't what diet they're doing or what their eating window is. It's a compliance issue.

I'm a long time proponent of IF, but to be honest I do think the mechanism of improved weight loss is probably calorie restriction.  But I don't take anything from a 10-hour eating window to prove or disprove that.

 This was unfortunately a promising study let down by their choice of poor parameters.",26,0.5346

And if you’re prone to binging you have to either learn not to binge during your eating window or the method could making binging behavior worse. 

I think another thing is that some people may need “permission” to choose to not eat. 3 meals a day plus snacking and sugar filled drinks in between have been drilled into us culturally.

t3_1ebbcfn,"The research on pretty much all dieting is the same: it's caloric deficit. No matter what you do, if you're in a deficit, you'll be losing weight.

A lot of the methods that exist otherwise are just designed to cause a calorie deficit. One example is increasing your fiber intake dramatically, which makes you feel more full and affects the speed of digestion. Less calories are absorbed, meaning you'll be in a deficit. 

Here's a great study (meta-analysis) that showed if you increase fiber intake, even if you don't change your diet, you'll lose fat:

The tricky part is how we achieve calorie deficit while maintaining the amount eaten. I personally think the main way is to focus on increasing veggie intake.

I really like big meals and I really like snacking at night. IM really helps with both those, also I have a few favorite cheats, my go to when I feel like being a fatty:

Family sized bag of salad, throw in some taco meat or cut up breaded chicken strips and for the dressing mix in a healthy portion of greek yogurt so you need less volume of the fatty stuff. I usually add some bacon as well as salad topper (nuts and cranberries). This salad is comically large, delicious and I sit around after rubbing my belly happy as can be and the meal was maybe 1000 calories (at most) and contains like 60G of protein.  

I also buy riced cauliflower, puree it with some almond milk and use it 50/50 with mashed potatoes with greek yogurt then throw over my butter chicken or meat sauce. Again, maybe 1000 calories in total but we're talking a laughable portion of food.

Use whichever method helps you to break your bad eating habits. The latter works for me. I don't want to even think about food or going to the fridge until tomorrow lunchtime. 

When I try calorie counting I'm ravenous all the time, and eating becomes a focal point throughout the day - an obsession. My activities are just 'doing something for a handful of hours until the next meal time.' I don't like splitting my day up into mealtimes.

But when I do OMAD fasting, after the first week my hunger diminishes and becomes a small itch that I don't have to scratch (I believe that's because my insulin falls and evens out), and dissipates entirely if I keep myself busy. My activities become my focal points, not my mealtimes.

Walking/hiking smallish hills one hour every other day, that's a legs day.

Generally all people wanting to lose weight need to do some kind of exercise for 1 hour a day every day, and aim for 2,000 calories or less. Because the body needs to burn off more than it's consuming.

Even if a person is terrified of working out in public, there are tons of things a person can do in their own homes. Dancing is one. Youtube has plenty of home gym type videos for free.

Scrubbing the walls of a shower and the tub itself, that's an arms day right there. Do that once a week.

Washing the car? That's an arms day, and a few squats, too, around the wheels and baseboards. Vacuuming in a car? Whole body workout.

Kon Mari your whole house? Lifting bags of clothes, books, etc, that's another arms and back day.

I think part of the food addiction is people are wired to engage in movement. And if we do movement in other things, folding clothes, washing car, sipping water while walking the neighborhood, that is doing something. Our body wants to keep moving.
