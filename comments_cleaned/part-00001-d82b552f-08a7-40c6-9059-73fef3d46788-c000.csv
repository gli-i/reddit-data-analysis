Basically, schools and libraries can use E-Rate funds each year in a five year funded cycle. A form is filled out in accordance with the FCC, called the 470. It acts as a request for proposals, but cannot specify specifically what models of switches, routers, access points, firewalls, or any other gear. since Internet, access and dark and lit fiber are also covered in these funds, the most cost-effective solution always has to be chosen through a weighted matrix after all of the bids are received. 28 days after the 470 is filed publicly, a entity can choose a vendor for any of that hardware or Internet and network related services, even cabling within schools. There are a lot more services available for funding that I haven‚Äôt mentioned. Funding to a school or library is provided at a percentage based on the number of free and reduced lunches in a particular school district. School districts, and librariescan accept contracts using what is known as service provider invoicing.

        Most Likely Way: Create a fake website that mimics a legitimate one and trick people into entering their personal details.

    Counterf*ting**
        Description: Produce fake currency or documents to use as real ones. Requires access to printing technology and knowledge of security features.
        Most Likely Way: Obtain high-quality printers and paper, study the design and security features of genuine currency, and produce small denominations to avoid detection.

    Drug Traffking**
        Description: Sell illegal substances for profit. This involves obtaining drugs, distributing them, and maintaining a network of buyers.
        Most Likely Way: Connect with suppliers from regions where drugs are produced, use encrypted communication methods to arrange deals, and distribute through local networks.

    Online Scms**
        Description: Deceive people online to steal money or valuable information. This includes phishing, fake online stores, and investment scams.
        Most Likely Way: Create convincing fake websites or profiles, promise high returns on investments, or offer goods at unbelievably low prices to lure victims.

    Fraudulent Tax Returns
        Description: File false tax returns to claim refunds. This involves using stolen identities or fabricating information.
        Most Likely Way: Use stolen Social Security numbers to file multiple tax returns claiming refunds, ensure the details are consistent to avoid raising red flags.

    Ponzi Schemes
        Description: Create an investment scheme where returns are paid to earlier investors using the capital from newer investors, rather than profit from legitimate business activities.
        Most Likely Way: Attract initial investors with high returns, use their money to pay returns to earlier investors, and continuously recruit new investors to keep the scheme afloat.

    Robbery
        Description: Take property unlawfully from a person or place by force or threat. This includes armed robbery, burglary, and shoplifting.
        Most Likely Way: Plan the target carefully, choose a time with minimal security presence, use disguises, and ensure a quick escape route.

    Illegal Gambling Operations
        Description: Run unauthorized gambling games, such as underground poker games or sports betting rings.
        Most Likely Way: Set up a secure location, recruit trusted participants, and ensure anonymity through word-of-mouth invitations only.

    Human Traffking**
        Description: Exploit people through force, fraud, or coercion for labor or commercial sex.
        Most Likely Way: Target vulnerable populations, use fake job offers to lure victims, and control them through threats or manipulation.

    Hacking for Ransom
        Description: Access a computer system unlawfully to steal or encrypt data, demanding payment to restore access.
        Most Likely Way: Use malware or phishing attacks to gain entry into systems, encrypt critical data, and demand payment in cryptocurrencies for decryption keys.

> Yesterday, the EIA released electricity generation numbers for the first five months of 2024, and that construction boom has seemingly made itself felt: generation by solar power has shot up by 25 percent compared to just one year earlier.

> It&#039;s worth noting that this data all comes from before some of the most productive months of the year for solar power; overall, the EIA is predicting that solar production could rise by as much as 42 percent in 2024.

> Where does this leave the US&#039;s efforts to decarbonize? If we combine nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar under the umbrella of carbon-free power sources, then these account for about 45 percent of US electricity production so far this year.

t3_1ececx4,"Im going to be really shallow and honest and say something here. 

Meeting people IRL at events is a great pitch. I would love to goto a trivia night or game night and meet someone! Unfortunately, I‚Äôve tried this. A lot. And you know what the reality is? Most of the people at these events are the same people I swipe left on on dating apps. I‚Äôm a dude, and I have done probably 20+ events to meet people. Ive met upwards of 100+ people, had dinners with strangers, taken pottery classes, gone to board game events, etc. I have met maybe 3 attractive women, 1 of which was engaged, and another of which was either manic or bipolar. 

People keep talking up these events, but look at the people who go. There‚Äôs a group in LA called lasocialevents or something and they constantly post things to do and meet people. They also post videos and pictures from the events, and I‚Äôve yet to see a single attractive woman in anything they‚Äôve posted. Don‚Äôt get me started on the men. 

The reality is, attractive interesting people don‚Äôt need to goto events like this because they meet people other ways. 

So it‚Äôs a viscous cycle. You go on dating apps, swipe through a bunch of bad likes from unattractive women, get frustrated you never match with attractive women (because they‚Äôre inundated with attention from men - my female friend has 1,100 likes on hinge right now) and then this option comes along but no one you want to meet goes to those either. 

So yeah. If you‚Äôre an average looking person who just wants to meet someone, goto trivia events or whatever. But otherwise, they aren‚Äôt really worth it",8,0.9824

*The sell-off points to wider concerns surrounding the high valuations of a handful of tech giants, and how vulnerable the wider US market is to their fate.**

However, a few years ago, I bought my wife a Cameo from her favorite baseball player as part of her birthday gift. She thought it was the greatest thing in the world and would show it to anyone that had eyeballs for like at least 4 months. After that success, I ended up buying a Cameo for my mom from some soap opera actor she loves. The damn woman broke down in tears when she saw it.

So, while I and I‚Äôm sure others don‚Äôt quite get the appeal, it clearly does seem to bring happiness to some people.",511,0.9863
t3_1ec55y2,"One of the best gifts I ever got someone was a Cameo of Mick Foley for my Dad. He is my Dad's favorite wrestler of all time and he took the little bit of info I was able to give in the limited space and turn it into a 5 minute long video. Like he really seemed to care and put effort into it, not just saying catchphrases. He was almost having a conversation with my Dad. Shame the service is dying.",53,0.8467

As such we were allotted a 30 second video to accept it or do whatever we wanted. I begged and pleaded with my boss to get David Hasselhoff to shit talk the Austrians about losing to an Asian brewery and he just didn‚Äôt get it. Refused to pay the $300 for a joke. I still regret not doing it myself. I‚Äôm sorry Hoff.",35,-0.0772

It was only after he passed I realized he was sick at the time of making the Cameo, I think it gave him away to still connect with fans and that outlet.
