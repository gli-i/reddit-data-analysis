I came across Cameo and sure enough Peter Macon AKA Bortus was on there , bought him it for a Xmas present.

He recorded a pretty long, great vid that really touched my dad and made him tear up. He has been going thru a hard time and afterwards definitely seemed in better spirits.

I am not advocating that voice actors be replaced with ai, but saying you can't use any form of ai voice seems like it would be an unnecessary limitation on developers. Games like balders gate would be amazing if every name you give your character was spoken aloud durring dialog. Or they could compensate the actor for their original recordings at a rate which would account for some later added features needing to use a trained ai to add in a few lines here and there for story line changes or added quests.

I don't care if my cable is 500+ channels. I care for the fact I use 5 channel regularly, maybe 10 over all. Stuck across 5 tiers, but paying for 6 tiers for a prices same or less than 5 tiers on their own?

I don't binge watch shows. I watch the movie or series once, and that's usually it. It might be 9months to a year before I'm interested in watching again.

$15 a month in say New York is valued less than very rural areas like central US, in my case Oklahoma and Kansas. It might take the average person a fraction of an hour, up to an hour, to make $15. Good on them. Many in rural areas it may take up to 2 hours of work. (After taxes.) Value matters.

Let's not forget signing up for a service, and months later they change the agreements, barely say anything to the users (*but we sent out an email that almost no one looked at!*), and wonder why people are complaining or leaving.

Personally, like many others, if I signed up for a service with understanding and agree to version 1 of the agreement that was out at that moment I clicked agree, I expect that agreement to stay the same while I continue to pay. If that agreement is changed, I should not only have to re-agree to that change, but should not be effective until the renewal of the prior paid agreement ends, and I should not be charged again until I agree to the new changed agreements. *But people will be inconvenienced!* We already are.

>On Thursday, researchers from security firm Binarly revealed that Secure Boot is completely compromised on more than 200 device models sold by Acer, Dell, Gigabyte, Intel, and Supermicro. The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what’s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https : //github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000\\_4000.git, and it's not clear when it was taken down.  
>  
>The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot.  
>  
>“It’s a big problem,” said Martin Smolár, a malware analyst specializing in rootkits who reviewed the Binarly research and spoke to me about it. “It’s basically an unlimited Secure Boot bypass for these devices that use this platform key. So until device manufacturers or OEMs provide firmware updates, anyone can basically… execute any malware or untrusted code during system boot. Of course, privileged access is required, but that’s not a problem in many cases.”  
>  
>...  
>  
>The researchers soon discovered that the compromise of the key was just the beginning of a much bigger supply-chain breakdown that raises serious doubts about the integrity of Secure Boot on more than 300 additional device models from virtually all major device manufacturers. As is the case with the platform key compromised in the 2022 GitHub leak, an additional 21 platform keys contain the strings “DO NOT SHIP” or “DO NOT TRUST.”  
>  
>These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren't clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.  
>  
>...  
>  
>There's little that users of an affected device can do other than install a patch if one becomes available from the manufacturer. In the meantime, it's worth remembering that Secure Boot has a history of not living up to its promises. The most recent reminder came late last year with the disclosure of LogoFAIL, a constellation of image-parsing vulnerabilities in UEFI libraries from just about every device maker. By replacing the legitimate logo images with identical-looking ones that have been specially crafted to exploit these bugs, LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute malicious code at the most sensitive stage of the boot process, which is known as DXE, short for Driver Execution Environment.  
>  
>“My takeaway is ‘yup, \\[manufacturers\\] still screw up Secure Boot, this time due to lazy key management,’ but it wasn't obviously a change in how I see the world (secure boot being a fig leaf security measure in many cases),” HD Moore, a firmware security expert and CTO and co-founder at runZero, said after reading the Binarly report. “The story is that the whole UEFI supply chain is a hot mess and hasn't improved much since 2016.”

t3_1ec1lye,"**How robots and AI change the meaningfulness of work**

July 19th was a day for help-desk heroes and support superstars. A routine software update by CrowdStrike, a cyber-security company, caused computer outages in offices, hospitals and airports worldwide. Most white-collar workers looked disconsolately at their screens and realised just how useless they are if they cannot log in. People in IT came to the rescue of helpless colleagues and stranded passengers. Their work that day was full of stress—but also full of meaning.

If machines can add purpose to some jobs when they fail, what about when they work properly? This is not an idle question. Discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) in particular easily get lost in hypothetical debates about wholesale job losses or, worse, the nature of consciousness. But technologies tend to spread in less dramatic ways, task by task rather than role by role. Before machines replace individuals, they change the nature of the work they do.

That is likely to affect job satisfaction. Many employees put a higher premium on non-monetary than monetary rewards. A recent Federal Reserve discussion paper by Katherine Lim and Mike Zabek surveyed American workers who had switched jobs to find out whether and why they thought their new positions were better; they found that interest in the work mattered more to people than pay and benefits.

Which is why another recent paper, from Milena Nikolova and Femke Cnossen of the University of Groningen and Boris Nikolaev of Colorado State University, makes for sobering reading. The authors looked at the prevalence of robots in industrial settings and how that affected workers. Robots reduced the perceived meaningfulness of jobs across the board, irrespective of age, gender, skills and the type of work. In theory, machines can free up time for more interesting tasks; in practice, they seem to have had the opposite effect.

In a separate paper, Ms Nikolova and Ms Cnossen, along with Anthony Lepinteur of the University of Luxembourg, explore why this might be. They find that industrial robots make jobs less physically taxing. But the number of tasks that remain open to humans dwindles, hurting both the variety of work and people’s understanding of the production process. Work becomes more routine, not less.

Machines need not have a dulling effect. In their research Ms Nikolova and her co-authors found that people did not perceive a loss of autonomy if they were working with computers, where they have more control of the machine than the other way round. (Presuming, of course, you can turn it on.) And automation may well have a different impact on service industries like health care, where less time spent on drudge work might indeed mean more time with patients.

A paper from 2011 by Michael Barrett of the University of Cambridge and his co-authors found that the introduction of drug-dispensing robots into hospital pharmacies had disparate effects. Pharmacists felt the quality of their jobs had improved because they had more time for patient counselling. Like the IT administrators rolling back the CrowdStrike update, technicians enjoyed the enhanced status that came with knowing how to fix the robots. Pharmacy assistants had a more miserable time of it, however, as their role shrank to loading medicine into the machines.

Consumer reactions to automation can also vary. An experiment conducted by Eugina Leung, now of Tulane University, and her co-authors tested how customers reacted to different descriptions of a cooking set. People who prided themselves on being skilled chefs really didn’t like products that promised to do everything at the touch of a button. A technology that cuts down on boring tasks is fine; one that threatens your sense of identity is not.

It is still too early to know how AI will affect the quality of work. Some will surely enjoy using a bot to brainstorm ideas and take care of menial tasks. Yet research by Pok Man Tang of the University of Georgia and his co-authors also suggests that workers who interact more with AI assistants feel lonelier and crave more social contact. 

The thing for managers to remember is that machines can make employees feel differently about their work. So it matters whether new technologies are introduced in collaboration with employees or imposed from above, and whether they enhance or sap their sense of competence. Bosses who ignore these issues are missing something meaningful.",9,0.9939

>Israel’s New $1.2 Billion Laser Will Be Nearly Unstoppable—And America Wants One, Too

>This air-defense system never runs out of ammunition and can destroy threats up to 4.3 miles away.

>BY  DAVID HAMBLING

>PUBLISHED: JUL 24, 2024

>Israel had defeated virtually the entire attack, swatting cruise missiles, ballistic missiles ,rockets, and drones from the sky. And that was by design.

>“Israel is a narrow strip of land with dense urban population centers. That does not leave much depth, so there is a premium on intercepting threats in flight,” explains James Black, assistant director at RAND Europe, a nonprofit think tank. But Israel’s sophisticated, multi-layered integrated air-defense systems couldn’t stop everything. Nine Iranian missiles reportedly struck Nevatim and Ramon Airbases, and one person was injured by shrapnel. The waves of drones, missiles, and rockets synchronized to hit simultaneously were meant to overload Israeli defenses and exhaust stocks of interceptors. The wall held well this time, but Israeli planners know it’s a numbers game.

>“Looking at both Israel and Ukraine, we are seeing defenders burning through missiles faster than industry can replace them,” Black says. So, Israel wants an air-defense system that never runs out of ammunition: Iron Beam.

>A $1.2 billion U.S. aid package will help fund deployment of Iron Beam, Israel’s one-of-a-kind, high-power laser system designed to knock down missiles, rockets, and drones. It’s a big bet on unproven technology—but success would yield an almost invincible defensive shield. Assuming all goes to plan, Iron Beam will be a lifesaver for the Israelis, who suffer regular aerial attacks. Yemen’s Houthi Rebels alone have lobbed more than 220 kamikaze drones and missiles at Israel since the war with Hamas broke out in October 2023. And then there is Iran and Hezbollah, of course. As weapons proliferate and ranges increase, America could one day face the same problem—but lasers could solve that issue at the speed of light.

>OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS “SHIELD OF LIGHT,” Iron Beam is a 100 kilowatt-class High-Energy Laser Weapon System, which Rafael Advanced Defense Systems first unveiled in2014. Rafael is also a contractor on Iron Dome. “Iron Beam will not replace Iron Dome, but complement it. Directed Energy offers a way to prioritize kinetic interceptors against the threats they are most needed for,” Black says. Specifically, Iron Beam will be integrated as an additional short-range layer to destroy threats up to 4.3 miles away.

>Unlike missiles, Iron Beam can keep firing as long as it has power.

>“Much of the interest in lasers stems from the magazine depth they offer,” Black says.“ This is not quite infinite—parts and energy supplies do not last forever—but they do give a very deep magazine compared to batteries of missiles.”

>Another important aspect is the cost per intercept. One Iron Dome interceptor missile costs $40,000–$50,000, according to Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. While cruise missiles can run to millions of dollars, Iran’s long-range Shahed-136 drones are simple, low-tech machines costing less than $30,000 apiece. Hamas mainly relies on Qassam home-made rockets, assembled from industrial pipes and improvised explosives, costing less than $1,000 each.",90,-0.9467

Israel isn't the only state working on laser system: the UK had began testing similar system in the last few months; the US navy had been experimenting with lasers for years now.

It seems likely that Israel's system will be the first to see combat, for the simple reason that Israel is under constant attack by terrorists using cheap, small UAVs.

Ukraine could also use such a system; however, Ukraine is much larger than Israel, and the short-range nature of laser systems will require a huge number of units (same problem with their use of an Iron Dome or similar system).",289,-0.8834

It's not just Predators, VRChat is meant for 13+, there are young teens who are clearly not mature enough for their age on VR (in turn suspected to actually be under 13 in a lot of cases), and many who are actually under 13. There's very little action discussed about these issues, and very little one can do to report underage related issues.

Any point of communication presents a risk. Parents can point their fingers all they want, but the responsibility to teach their children the dangers of interacting with others, especially adults, resides with them.

Disinformation experts who spoke with The 19th said highlighting or linking to more specific disinformation about Harris risks amplifying it.

t3_1ebwx5n,"Let's look at the track-record of a roboticist who's been in industry for the past 14 years...

- The first place to ever *fire* me imploded. Then the manager that fired me stole some intellectual property and went to that company's direct competitor to be never heard from again.
- Second place to fire me also imploded. It was full of a bunch of engineers who wanted to build a real product, lead by engineers who just wanted to tinker, all bitching about the sales & marketing teams who operated independently of technical input. They've since rebranded, and are still desparate to hire a new robotics engineering team... Especially since they're not making any money and don't have anyone to build new products, let alone maintain their existing fleets.
- Third place to fire me was a $2bln company whose CEO / Board President (depending on the week) was basically caught violating ITAR among other investment frauds, fled the country, and now that business no longer has operations in the U.S.
- Fourth place to fire me was a small startup where the CEO got lucky as an undergrad and had no idea how to actually build a product, manage customer expectations, and manage a business. Oh, and though he'd frequently state that he doesn't want anyone to be afraid of making mistakes, never hesitated for a moment to shitcan anyone who *he thought* wasn't performing. I laughed both times he went behind my back, fired my team, found out that he fucked all of us in his ignorance, and rehired each of them as contractors for double what he was paying as direct employees.
- Fifth place to fire me didn't give me any real support, the software was insanely complex all due to political reasons, and responded to any \"tall poppies\" by swiftly firing them before their own ineptitude is known outside of the team.
- Not so much a firing as a contract being suspended... The client's executive team can't make up their minds, so they asked my bosses if they could furlough me for four months.

The places that didn't cut me were all across the spectrum. One really awesome, one not so much, and one that I didn't feel like I fit in at all. But one fact always remained:

>Growing resistance toward ribosome-targeting macrolide antibiotics has limited their clinical utility and urged the search for superior compounds. Macrolones are synthetic macrolide derivatives with a quinolone side chain, structurally similar to DNA topoisomerase-targeting fluoroquinolones. While macrolones show enhanced activity, their modes of action have remained unknown. Here, we present the first structures of ribosome-bound macrolones, showing that the macrolide part occupies the macrolide-binding site in the ribosomal exit tunnel, whereas the quinolone moiety establishes new interactions with the tunnel. Macrolones efficiently inhibit both the ribosome and DNA topoisomerase in vitro. However, in the cell, they target either the ribosome or DNA gyrase or concurrently both of them. In contrast to macrolide or fluoroquinolone antibiotics alone, dual-targeting macrolones are less prone to select resistant bacteria carrying target-site mutations or to activate inducible macrolide resistance genes. Furthermore, because some macrolones engage Erm-modified ribosomes, they retain activity even against strains with constitutive erm resistance genes.",1,0.2263

t3_1ebvbuu,"I’m not antibiotic adverse. If I need them, I will take them, along with vaccines, and any other form of modern medicine. Happily.

But antibiotic overuse is doing more than creating superbugs- it’s sterilizing our world, and that includes the symbiotic bacteria that make up our gut biomes. This is still not well understood but so many chronic illnesses are linked to poor gut health. That may include autoimmune diseases that are treated with immunosuppressant drugs, and conditions that cause poor immune functioning overall- which would leave people even more susceptible to superbugs.

I get what the article is saying, but taking antibiotics often eradicates what we do need for proboitics- ( I think that's still a thing? )

Abstract
Growing resistance toward ribosome-targeting macrolide antibiotics has limited their clinical utility and urged the search for superior compounds. Macrolones are synthetic macrolide derivatives with a quinolone side chain, structurally similar to DNA topoisomerase-targeting fluoroquinolones. While macrolones show enhanced activity, their modes of action have remained unknown. Here, we present the first structures of ribosome-bound macrolones, showing that the macrolide part occupies the macrolide-binding site in the ribosomal exit tunnel, whereas the quinolone moiety establishes new interactions with the tunnel. Macrolones efficiently inhibit both the ribosome and DNA topoisomerase in vitro. However, in the cell, they target either the ribosome or DNA gyrase or concurrently both of them. In contrast to macrolide or fluoroquinolone antibiotics alone, dual-targeting macrolones are less prone to select resistant bacteria carrying target-site mutations or to activate inducible macrolide resistance genes. Furthermore, because some macrolones engage Erm-modified ribosomes, they retain activity even against strains with constitutive erm resistance genes.",1,0.3818
