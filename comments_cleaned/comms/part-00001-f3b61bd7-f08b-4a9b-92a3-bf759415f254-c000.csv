That looks like Logitech have developed a horribly expensive mouse, which no one in their right mind would spend ¬£200 quid on - and they've then got their marketing team together to brainstorm it.

How do we get someone to spend ¬£200 on a mouse they've asked - and some brainiac has pointed out that over a human life time, we probably do all buy a few mice which in total - could add up to ¬£200 in total.

\"Great\" someone senior has said - what would make it a mouse that lasts forever. Answer - \"One which requires friggin constant updates\"",2,16:47:12,0.1111

1. **Increased Censorship:**

LISP had the power of full control over the AST, but this requires that you need to manually build this AST, making for expressions that would be intuitive to a programmer like `(5 + 2)^2  * 4 ^ 3` have to be written as `(* (^ (+ 5 2) 2) (^ 4 3))` which is a bit clunky some times, but has the huge advantage that the semantics (operation ordering etc.) are very very clear.
