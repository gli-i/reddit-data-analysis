In Asian countries, marrying another Asian from a different country is considered interracial.  Chinese/Korean is considered mixed in China or Korea if one of the parents is a first generation immigrant.  It gets hazy if the parent is a 2nd gen immigrant in Korea and China, but in Japan it’s generally still considered mixed no matter how many generations.  For example the Japanese emperor considers himself partially mixed because he had a single Korean ancestor over 1000 years ago.

I guess it's because whether to use an argument once or multiple times is usually pretty fundamental to the idea of what that specific function should do.

In 2018, most of the expenditure was allocated towards price discounts, which could expose susceptible youths to tobacco promotion. Future studies should examine the extent to which consumers, particularly youth, notice or engage with price promotions.

Over the next 14 days, the rodents were exposed to female Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes for 10 minutes every day – all three mosquito species are r",15,14:20:00,0.4404
