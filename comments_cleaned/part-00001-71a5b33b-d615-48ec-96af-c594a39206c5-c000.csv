t3_1eb5e36,">How Feminist Heterosexual Men Navigate Their Sexual Desire While Following Feminist Principles

>Abstract

>Feminist considerations have influenced how women and men view sex, affecting not only women's perspectives but also men’s feelings about sexual desire with regard to gender equity. This might be especially the case among men who self-identify as feminist. However, how men should manage their sexual desire or communicate about it within relationships with women is not always clear in this evolving social climate. Thus, the current study aimed to explore the successes and/or struggles feminist heterosexual men experience while navigating their desires alongside feminist considerations. To explore this, we recruited feminist-identified heterosexual men in long-term relationships. We asked participants (*N* = 30) a series of questions regarding their sexual desire, considering the context of their long-term relationships and evolving gender norms, during a one-on-one interview via Zoom. Using thematic analysis, we identified 11 themes from the interview data. We found that, though the feminist men in this study were all aware of negative societal perceptions of heterosexual men’s sexual desire, most men in this study did not feel conflicts between their feminist principles and their own sexual desires. This is because they reported already following feminist principles; those who felt ambivalent navigated this by communicating with their partners. Findings demonstrate the usefulness and positive impact men report feminism having on them, their sexuality, and their long-term relationships, by allowing them to better engage with their sexuality and partners.",9,0.9818

t3_1eb5e36,"From the article: Sexual desire has traditionally been viewed as a simple and singular phenomenon, often associated with the pursuit of sexual pleasure, particularly orgasm. Contemporary research views sexual desire as a multifaceted experience influenced by various situational and psychological factors. For men, sexual desire is often framed in terms of masculinity, with societal expectations dictating that men should always have high levels of sexual desire. This traditional view overlooks the complexity of men’s sexual desire and the experiences of those who do not fit this stereotype.

Feminism has brought significant changes in how sexual desire is perceived and expressed, particularly among men who identify as feminists. These men often face the challenge of reconciling their sexual desires with feminist principles that promote gender equity and respect. In this work, researchers Eun Ju Son and colleagues explored the experiences of feminist heterosexual men in long-term relationships.

Participants, who were primarily recruited from the Kingston community in Canada, were between the ages 21 to 57 years, with an average relationship duration of 9.54 years. Participants were interviewed by one of four interviewers for approximately 45 minutes.

He spots the issue with his analysis, but hand waves it away.

> Figure 11 shows the empirical autocorrelation functions of the 
CO2 series, original and differenced. In the instrumental series, the autocorrelations are almost 1, even for lags as high as 100. This prohibits any inference from the original series. However, their differenced series have reasonable positive autocorrelations, which make inference possible. **The proxy series have high autocorrelations at small lags, but reasonable ones at large lags.** For those, both the original and the differenced series are examined, provided that the latter are positive.

Then looking at all the following data. I see what looks graphs looking like the 'hen or egg' scenario that the author talks about... ie, auto-correlation.

I look at the data provided, and I see that CO2 and temperature are too closely correlated to say definitively one came before the other... particularly since the author makes no attempt to study what would happen if there was 'variance' in the data.

This 'too close to call' argument is the same argument that the author uses to dismiss the data from others... but does a poor job of explaining why his analysis is somehow better.

That is, the causality direction is T-> [CO2] and not the opposite, as emphatically promoted in the last decades. This is the case not only in the distant past and on large time scales, but also in the recent period covered by reliable instrumental records. This happens not only at the monthly or annual time scale, but also at the decadal time scale, which can be resolved by the existing data sets.

In conclusion, both the paleoclimatic and the instrumental data confirm the same causality direction T -> [CO2] for all time scales, from very large to very short, and all periods. The mechanisms responsible to this causality direction are physical, related to the interaction of oceans and atmosphere, but mostly are related to the biosphere processes. Did human actions, such as fossil fuel combustion and other presumed 'unnatural' actions, reverse directionality, as the popular claim is? Perhaps, but no analysis based on observational data has shown that. Rather, such claims are based on imagination and climatic models full of assumptions. However, as shown in [22] the causality direction in time series produced by climatic models is opposite to that of the real-world data.\"",0,0.7227

\"General circulation models (GCMs) are the foundation of weather and climate prediction1,2. GCMs are physics-based simulators that combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine-learning models trained on reanalysis data have achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting3,4. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present a GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best machine-learning and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with machine-learning models for one- to ten-day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for one- to fifteen-day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140-kilometre resolution show emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs, although our model does not extrapolate to substantially different future climates. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.\"",3,0.8572

[Evidence of dark oxygen production at the abyssal seafloor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01480-8)

Abstract:

>Deep-seafloor organisms consume oxygen, which can be measured by in situ benthic chamber experiments. Here we report such experiments at the polymetallic nodule-covered abyssal seafloor in the Pacific Ocean in which oxygen increased over two days to more than three times the background concentration, which from ex situ incubations we attribute to the polymetallic nodules. Given high voltage potentials (up to 0.95 V) on nodule surfaces, we hypothesize that seawater electrolysis may contribute to this dark oxygen production.

From the main discussion:

>On the basis of these studies and DOP being observed in nodule-only ex situ incubations (Extended Data Fig. 4), we hypothesize that the DOP may have partly resulted from seawater electrolysis, with the necessary energy coming from the potential difference between metal ions within the nodule layers, leading to an internal redistribution of electrons. Whereas questions remain concerning this potential mechanism (such as the identity of the energy source(s), longevity of DOP, catalytic stabilities, electrochemical conditions on exposed versus buried nodules surfaces and the influence of different chemistries within the nodule layers), the ‘geo-battery’ hypothesis was supported by the link between DOP and nodule average surface area. This connection could be due to an increased abundance of anode and cathode sites or a greater abundance of high Ni and Cu dendritic porous layers in larger nodules. Assuming the ‘geo-battery’ is partly responsible for the DOP observed, the initial high DOP rate may have been related to the ‘bow-wave’ of the lander removing sediments from the surface of the nodules and exposing electrochemically active sites on the nodules. The slowdown in DOP seen later in the incubations could have then been caused by a reduction in voltage potential and/or degradation of metal-oxide catalysts that has been observed in Mn oxide catalysts previously. Whereas this process requires further investigation, if true, DOP activity may fluctuate with sediment coverage on the nodules inviting the urgent question of how sediment remobilization and distribution over large areas during deep-sea mining may influence DOP.
>
>Understanding the mechanism(s) behind DOP, its temporal nature and its spatial distribution will allow its role in abyssal ocean ecosystems to be better understood. Future studies of DOP in the deep sea may also shed light on broader relationships between metal-oxide deposition, biological evolution and the oxygenation of Earth.",10,0.9662

t3_1eb4bki,"This interesting topic brings to mind the criticism that Cordelia Fine offers in her book, \\*Delusions of Gender\\*. In essence, her primary argument suggests that while both gender and sex have a significant impact on life experiences, it does not necessarily follow that any statistically significant sexually dimorphic differences in the brain are hardwired from birth, as it is methodologically very challenging or impossible to isolate the variables needed to prove such a hypothesis experimentally. 

I acknowledge that statistically significant sexual dimorphism in the brain does exist; however, I believe it can be quite challenging, if not impossible, to definitively isolate life experiences as a variable causing those differences versus the idea that these differences are innate from birth.

It’s important to note that gender is not the only aspect influenced by socio-cultural factors; biological sex is also shaped by these factors. For example, the study linked here mentions in their findings that children assigned male at birth (AMAB) show greater sex congruence in their genders compared to children assigned female at birth (AFAB). The summary states: \"Extant literature suggests that AMAB children feel more pressure to conform to gender norms than AFAB children (27, 28). This may, in part, explain our results, in which AMAB children report stronger sex-congruent genders than AFAB children.\"

This indicates that the greater sex congruence observed in AMAB children may stem from socio-cultural pressures rather than being solely hardwired from birth. I must confess that I only skimmed this study, but it is encouraging that the authors appear to recognize the complexities in disentangling the influences of nature versus nurture, particularly concerning biological sex differences in neurology, not just gender.

Conducting a scientific investigation into neurological sexual dimorphism while ruling out nurture as a variable poses considerable challenges. Any methodology that attempts to completely isolate the \"nurture\" aspect would be either impractical or ethically questionable, as it is impossible to raise a child devoid of any nurturing influence.

I would suggest that even studies involving newborn infants cannot entirely exclude variables such as maternal diet choices during pregnancy based on gender preferences, such as eating more protein for a \"big strong boy\" or sweets for a \"sweet little girl.\" While this methodology might control for nurture to some extent compared to many current studies, it still cannot eliminate it completely.

Ultimately, to thoroughly determine if a purely \"nature,\" hardwired form of sexual dimorphism exists in the brain, it seems that a methodologically rigorous scientific approach would require the absence of the social construct of gender, thereby eliminating any nurturing-related variables. Unfortunately, achieving that scenario appears to be unlikely.",14,0.9814

“Sex and Gender Map onto Different Brain Networks in Children”

“A preliminary study suggests that sex and gender are represented differently in the brain”

“A new brain-imaging study of young adolescents has shown that sex and gender map onto different brain networks. The findings, published on Friday in Science Advances, demonstrate the importance of considering the social impact of gender in neuroscience research rather than conflating it with physiological sex.

“Moving forward, we really need to consider both sex and gender separately if we want to better understand the brain,” said study co-author Elvisha Dhamala, a neuroscientist at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, in a recent press conference.

Physiological sex is largely determined by chromosomes, genes, hormones and other biological systems. On top of that, cultural ideas about what it means to be, for example, a man, woman or nonbinary person—what we call gender—also play a critical role shaping people’s life and behavior. Scientists understand sex and gender to be related yet distinct concepts, but they are often conflated in neuroscience research. This means that differences between the brains of people who are assigned male or female at birth are often taken as reflections of biological differences when they could very well be the result of how each group is treated based on cultural expectations.

“The influence of being treated as a woman or as a man in our society is ignored” in neuroscience research, says Lara M. Wierenga, a neuroscientist who studies gender differences in brain development at Leiden University in the Netherlands and was not involved in the new research. “But we also know that the brain is very plastic, very open to experiences,” which can differ greatly between people assigned female or male at birth, she says.

For the new study, Dhamala’s team wanted to know what the field might be missing by ignoring the social impact of gender. The researchers worked with data from a large and ongoing longitudinal study of U.S. adolescents to compare brain scan data with questionnaire responses about the participants’ sex and gender from them and their parents.

While the researchers expected sex to be associated with differences in activity in certain brain networks, beyond that, “we had no idea whether or not [gender] would map onto the brain and also no idea where it would map onto the brain,” Dhamala says.

The study researchers analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 4,757 children aged nine or 10 years old. The fMRI scanner captured “resting-state” activity across different brain regions that occurs when someone is awake but not engaged in a specific task. The young participants had also been asked four questions about their feelings about their gender (such as “How much do you feel like a boy?”), and their parents had been asked 12 questions about how their child talked about their gender and how they engaged in play activities that are stereotypically “for boys” or “for girls.”

The researchers fed the brain-scan data, along with information about each participant’s sex, into a machine-learning model, which learned to pick out subtle differences in the activity of certain regions of the brain between the male and female groups. Then they tested the model on data it had not yet seen by asking it to predict participants’ sex based on their brain scans, which it accomplished with 77 percent accuracy.

Next, the researchers went on to train another machine-learning model to make predictions from the preteens’ and parents’ reports about gender. But because sex and gender are so strongly related to each other, the brain networks associated with each largely overlapped. To bring gender into clearer view, the team analyzed the participants’ gender variation separately by sex. This showed how and where brain activity differed between people who had been assigned the same sex at birth but had varying feelings and expression of their gender.

Finally, the researchers compared the networks associated with gender differences with those associated with sex differences. They found that while there was some overlap, these groups of networks were largely different from one another, though this difference was only statistically significant for the parent-reported gender data, not the self-reports. (The study authors think the self-report questionnaire was not sensitive enough to capture differences in how children think and feel about their gender.)

The brain networks unique to sex but not gender included networks with more well-defined roles in the brain, such as the visual network and motor network. Conversely, the networks that showed gender but not sex differences were more dispersed throughout the brain. It’s too soon to draw conclusions about why some networks were associated with sex and not gender and vice versa, Dhamala says: “We have no idea right now” if those differences relate to differences in behavior.

“This is really the first time that it’s shown in such a large dataset that not only sex but also gender is related to the way the brain is wired,” Wierenga says. “The expectations that we have [based on gender], they do matter.” This is important to understand because gender-related differences in the brain could impact how psychiatric disorders manifest across the gender spectrum, especially those that are underdiagnosed in people who were assigned female at birth (such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD) or who were assigned male (such as anxiety and mood disorders), Wierenga says.

Because the research was only done in children, it’s also not clear whether gender would map onto the brain differently from sex in adults, though Wierenga says she expects that this pattern would hold.

Dhamala’s team plans to rerun similar analyses on the same group of children as they grow. “These are still very young kids. And as they go through adolescence and into adulthood, their brain networks and their functional connectivity is going to be changing,” she says. In the meantime, the researchers say, other teams could begin testing gender as well as sex in their research to yield a clearer picture of brain-based differences throughout life.”",44,0.6995

>>To make their calculations, the study authors compiled data on actual costs from reforestation projects across low and middle income countries worldwide, and noted that that reforestation methods often entail planting trees of a single species to fill previously forested land.

t3_1eb0vui,"From the article: A team of Australian scientists is genetically engineering a common fly species so that it can eat more of humanity’s organic waste while producing ingredients for making everything from lubricants and biofuels to high-grade animal feeds.

Black soldier flies are already being used commercially to consume organic waste, including food waste, but tweaking their genetics could widen the range of waste their larvae consume while, in the process, producing fatty compounds and enzymes.

In a [scientific paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06516-8), the team based at Sydney’s Macquarie University outlined their hopes for the flies and how they could also cut the amount of planet-warming methane produced when organic waste breaks down.

“We are heading towards a climate disaster, and landfill waste releases methane. We need to get that to zero,” Dr Kate Tepper, a lead author of the paper, said.

Dr Maciej Maselko runs an animal synthetic biology lab at Macquarie University where Tepper has already started engineering the flies.

Maselko said insects would be the “next frontier” in dealing with the planet’s waste management problem, which weighs in at about 1bn tonnes a year in food waste alone.

Black soldier flies are found in all continents except Antarctica. “If you’ve got a compost bin, then you’ve probably got some,” Maselko said.

These ancient hitchhikers, known as endogenous retroviruses, were long considered inert or \"junk\" DNA, defanged of any ability to do damage. New CU Boulder research published July 17 in the journal \"Science Advances\" shows that, when reawakened, they can play a critical role in helping cancer survive and thrive. The study also suggests that silencing certain endogenous retroviruses can make cancer treatments work better.

“Our study shows that diseases today can be significantly influenced by these ancient viral infections that until recently very few researchers were paying attention to,” said senior author Edward Chuong, an assistant professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at CU Boulder's BioFrontiers Institute.

From the linked article: 

With their huge size, venomous bite and the fantastical connotations of their name, Komodo dragons seem like the stuff of legend.

Now, that status has been elevated further: scientists have discovered that their teeth are coated with a layer of iron that helps keep their serrated edges razor sharp.

It is the first time such a coating has been seen in any animal, and one the researchers describe as “a striking and previously overlooked predatory adaptation in the Komodo dragon”.

The coating was discovered when researchers noticed that the tips and serrated edges of Komodo dragons’ teeth were covered in a layer of orange pigment. On closer inspection, the enamel was found to contain concentrated iron that makes the teeth extra hard and resistant to wear, helping the dragons rip and tear their prey apart.

Komodo dragons’ curved, serrated teeth are a similar shape to those of carnivorous dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex. In the study, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, LaBlanc and his team set out to use the similarity to learn more about how dinosaur teeth might have been used when they were alive.",92,0.9371

A significant portion of this revenue comes from microtransactions — small in-game purchases that enhance the gaming experience. Among these, loot boxes, which offer random virtual items, have sparked considerable debate due to their similarity to gambling.

A recent study published in [Scientific Reports](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64812-z) explored whether gamers with autistic traits are more susceptible to excessive gaming and problematic gambling behaviors, and their spending patterns on loot boxes. Surprisingly, the study found that while gamers with higher levels of autistic traits may be more vulnerable to excessive gaming and problematic gambling, they actually spend less on loot boxes when their gambling symptoms are accounted for.

“Video gaming as a hobby has evolved substantially over the years, with how people access and play video games shifting along with technological advancements. Research into this increasingly popular hobby has grown in response,” said study author James D. Sauer of the University of Tasmania.

“One such change in the gaming industry includes the rise of the microtransaction monetization model. This allows games companies to accrue revenue from their product by offering additional, optional, in-game purchases. ‘Loot boxes’ are a particular type of microtransaction that has become prevalent within video games, and has received considerable attention from game users and researchers alike.”",8,0.0534

t3_1eavld4,"I’ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-024-01685-3

From the linked article: 

Researchers have combined the bacteria-killing actions of two classes of antibiotics into one, demonstrating that their new dual-action antibiotic could make bacterial resistance (almost) an impossibility.

Pathogens such as bacteria threaten human health, so we dole out antibiotics. The bacteria then develop resistance to the antibiotics. While bacterial threat remains the same, our treatment arsenal is less effective, if it’s effective at all. In essence, that’s the problem caused by antibiotic resistance.

But now, researchers from the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) may have replenished the arsenal with a new antibiotic, one that could make it nearly impossible for bacteria to develop resistance to.

“The beauty of this antibiotic is that it kills through two different targets in bacteria,” said Alexander Mankin, distinguished professor of pharmaceutical sciences at UIC and the study’s co-corresponding author. “If the antibiotic hits both targets at the same concentration, then the bacteria lose their ability to become resistant via [the] acquisition of random mutations in any of the two targets.”

“By basically hitting two targets at the same concentration, the advantage is that you make it almost impossible for the bacteria to easily come up with a simple genetic defense,” said Yury Polikanov, associate professor of biological sciences and another of the study’s corresponding authors.

Based on their results, the researchers estimated that their macrolone antibiotic “would make it 100 million times more difficult for bacteria to evolve resistance.”",26,0.145
t3_1eavld4,"They suggest that a pathogen with no resistance is unlikely to develop resistance. However, a pathogen which already has one resistance mechanism (e.g. efflux) can quite conceivably develop the second mechanism (e.g. modification/mutation of the target or enzymatic degradation).",5,-0.296
t3_1eavld4,"While it may make it more difficult, whatever researcher is claiming it \"could make it impossible\" needs to turn in their credentials.",18,-0.4201
t3_1eavld4,"Is there any way we can take some of the least effective antibiotics that have the most bacterial resistance against them and hold them in reserve for a while? I mean, just don't prescribe them until the resistance against them is selected out of the bacterial gene pool. And then reintroduce this class of antibiotics while retiring another class for a while so that resistance to this class can then also be selected against for a while. Rinse and repeat.

This was ballyhooed far and wide as the be-all end-all solution to that particular disease.

t3_1eamtf4,"A study indicates that memory is not limited to humans but also exists in bacteria

In a recent study, researchers lead by Dr. Ilana Kolodkin-Gal of Reichman University’s Scojen Institute for Synthetic Biology discovered that probiotics and biological control agents like Bacillus subtilis possess memory.

Even when the bacteria separate from their host, they can continue to express genes related to colonization and symbiosis for several generations. The ability to effectively recolonize a new host is provided by this information transfer between generations of bacteria, which gives them an advantage over naïve bacteria that have never established a stable connection with a plant.

The significance of the defenses that the bacteria develop during plant colonization is shown by the association between stress resistance and the genes with multigenerational inheritance patterns. The interactions between the beneficial bacteria and their host are stabilized through this multigenerational inheritance. According to the researchers, comparable mechanisms allow good probiotic bacteria from the same group to interact across generations in the human gut, providing long-term disease prevention.

From the above article:

Wild sharks off the coast of Brazil have tested positive for cocaine, according to new study by Brazilian scientists, in the latest research to demonstrate how illegal drug consumption by humans is harming marine life.

According to a study entitled Cocaine Shark and published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, scientists dissected the bodies of 13 sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon lalandii) caught in fishermen’s nets off a beach in Rio de Janeiro.

All 13 tested positive for the drug.

A separate study recently revealed that high levels of cocaine residue were causing “serious toxicological effects” in animals such as brown mussels, oysters and eels in Santos Bay, in the Brazilian state of São Paulo.

But the concentration found in the Rio sharks was 100 times higher than had been found in other marine animals, the researchers said.

How the cocaine ended up in the sharks remains a mystery.

There are a few possibilities: one is that the drug fell in the sea during transshipment or was dumped in the sea by smugglers attempting to evade authorities.

Brazil does not produce large amounts of cocaine, but is a major exporter, with powerful street gangs such as the First Capital Command (PCC) sending tonnes of the drug in shipping containers to Europe.

Another possible explanation is that the cocaine reached the sea in sewage discharges – and from there passed into the sharks.",1,0.0129

t3_1eaiw5a,"Well, current research shows THC binds mostly to CB1 receptor, and it binds it strongly. Previous research shows binding this receptor too strongly promotes paranoia and worsened anxiety, consistent with the observed effect that some marijuana can relieve anxiety whereas too much can worsen it. 

The role of CBD is thought to be a CB1 partial agonist, meaning it binds the receptor but not nearly as strongly. This should reduce the overall binding of THC and reduce the paranoia and anxiety associated with too strong of binding, as some of the THC-CB1 receptor bonds have been broken by the partial agonist CBD. 

This research looked mostly at functional MRI connectivity networks such as the salience network and ECN. It basically shows that the \"disruption\" of these networks is still present with both THC alone and THC+CBD administration. The authors are kind of speculating that this indicates the patients experience of the intoxicating effects of these substances is the same with THC alone and with THC+CBD alone. However they did not measure the patients subjective experience at all, and that is likely to be done in a future study. 

Overall it is an interesting thesis and future research may show the authors conclusion to be correct, but I'm not convinced it is demonstrated here. It would certainly upend some of the current teaching surrounding THC and CBD so I'm curious to see the future research",200,-0.0437

t3_1eaiw5a,"From the article: In a recent study published in the journal [Neuropsychopharmacology](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01891-6), researchers have found that cannabidiol (CBD) does not mitigate the disruptive effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain connectivity. In fact, the study suggests that CBD might even exacerbate these effects in some cases. This challenges the commonly held belief that CBD can counterbalance the psychoactive impact of THC in cannabis.

The research was motivated by the growing use of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, a period characterized by significant brain development. Previous studies indicated that chronic cannabis use during adolescence could lead to changes in brain connectivity and cognitive impairments. However, there was a lack of detailed research on the acute effects of cannabis in this age group, especially considering the different compositions of cannabis with varying levels of THC and CBD.

THC is the main psychoactive component, responsible for the euphoric “high” and cognitive alterations associated with cannabis use. CBD, on the other hand, is non-psychoactive and has been suggested to have potential therapeutic properties, such as reducing anxiety and possessing anti-inflammatory effects. While THC binds directly to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, influencing mood, perception, and cognition, CBD interacts more subtly with these receptors and can modulate the effects of THC.

The study was conducted as part of the larger “CannTeen” project and involved 48 semi-regular cannabis users. The participants were evenly divided into two groups: 24 adolescents with a mean age of 17.2 years and 24 adults with a mean age of 27.8 years. The selection criteria ensured that participants had used cannabis between 0.5 and 3 days per week over the past three months. The researchers aimed to match the cannabis use frequency between the adolescent and adult groups.",4,0.9255

But if we are going to talk about the effects of sunscreen on coral health, zinc oxide is actually one of the more toxic filters to coral (this pigment was used in combination with zinc — though perhaps it works similarly with organic filters, idk). This is harm-reducing by reducing the concentration of zinc, but still using one of the more toxic filters to coral.

I’m also curious as to how this affects UVA protection. As an SPF booster, it may not actually offer the UVA protection of the zinc it’s displacing in a sunscreen formula. This happens in a lot of newer “100% mineral” sunscreens that use butyloctyl salicylate as an “inactive” ingredient. And unfortunately we don’t have a great selection of approved UV filters with good long-wavelength UV absorption in the US.

t3_1eaal9g,"Scientists have discovered that some cancer cells pretend to be ‘super fit’ to fool normal healthy cells into giving them their nutrients, allowing them to expand and spread around the body.

A team from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, found that ‘cheating’ cancer cells develop the ability to hijack the body’s natural ‘cell competition’ process, which ensures that substandard cells do not accumulate but instead are killed and removed.

The researchers, based in the Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and largely funded by Breast Cancer Now, hope that having a better understanding of how the cell competition mechanism is exploited by cancer cells will lead to new ways of treating the disease.

Normally, this evolutionary principle of ‘survival of the fittest’ is a crucial quality control mechanism for maintaining tissue health and function. However, defects in cell competition can result in the retention of damaged or dangerous cells, potentially triggering the formation of tumours.

Quoting [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7040264/) research : 

“There is so much wastage of drugs as they are not used in time. Medications are expensive, and in the Asian and African continents, where many have the problem of affordability the debate is to see if the medication could be used even after the expiry date without losing the efficacy. Most of drug expiration dates information is from the study conducted by the Food and Drug Administration at the request of the military. With a large and expensive stockpile of drugs, the military faced tossing out and replacing its drugs every few years. What they found from the study is 90% of more than 100 drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, were perfectly good to use even 15 years after the expiration date.

Hence, the expiration date doesn’t really indicate a point at which the medication is no longer effective or has become unsafe to use.”",62,0.8856

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-024-00414-3

From the linked article:

When it comes to crewed missions to Mars there is no shortage of hazards, from space radiation to a hostile environment. Now researchers have found another snag: many of the medicines astronauts may take with them are likely to expire before they return to Earth.

Researchers say they have discovered a host of medications used in space have a shelf life of three years or less – a problem given Nasa expects a mission to Mars to take roughly 36 months.

Dr Dan Buckland, the senior study author from Duke University School of Medicine, said that on Earth, expired medication was usually less effective, although by how much is unpredictable.

“The risk is that an illness later in a Mars mission would end up with a greater severity than had it occurred earlier in the mission before the medication has expired,” he said.

Buckland and colleagues used a Freedom of Information Act (FoI) request to gather a list of the medications onboard the International Space Station (ISS). While the exact medications that would be taken to Mars are not yet known, Buckland said those on the ISS were likely to make up the bulk of a medical kit for such a mission.

Writing in the journal npj Microgravity, the team revealed how they found terrestrial shelf-life data for 91 of the 106 medications on the 2023 ISS list, with their maximum shelf life dates suggesting 54 of the medications would expire by 36 months, including certain painkillers.

Fourteen of the medications would expire by 24 months, including one advanced life support medication, one anaphylaxis treatment medication, two antibiotics and one antipsychotic.

When each medication’s minimum shelf life was considered, 89 of the 106 medications were found to expire by 36 months.",2,0.7184

t3_1ea4f4l,"From the article: A new study published in the journal [Autism Research](https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.3174) sheds light on the attentional patterns of young autistic children and their relationship with sensory experiences. The researchers found notable connections between “sticky attention” and certain sensory behaviors, such as heightened sensory responsiveness and intense interests. Additionally, the study uncovered a novel attentional pattern dubbed “springy attention,” where autistic children tended to return their gaze to familiar stimuli rather than focusing on new ones.

Prior research has highlighted various atypical attention forms in autism, such as difficulty disengaging from certain stimuli (known as “sticky attention”). Understanding these patterns is vital as they could influence sensory processing, which in turn affects daily activities, social interactions, and overall quality of life.

“Many autistic people have uncommon sensory experiences, and some of these can be quite overwhelming – it takes a lot of extra coping energy to go through the world if you are frequently having distressing and exhausting episodes of sensory overload,” said study author Patrick Dwyer, a research fellow at the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre at Trobe University.

“We also know that many young autistic people show different attention patterns to neurotypical people. Attention differences in autism could also affect learning. If somebody pays attention to different things, they will learn different information from their environment, and this could go on to have cascading effects on ongoing learning and development.”",34,0.5423

t3_1ea3xxt,">Overall, the 2dDR-SA treatment was 80-90% as effective as minoxidil, and there were no significant gains in combining 2dDR-SA and minoxidil, suggesting that the sugar compound has great potential as an affordable and safe alternative to current offerings.

>“This pro-angiogenic deoxy ribose sugar is naturally occurring, inexpensive and stable and we have shown it can be delivered from a variety of carrier gels or dressings,\" said Muhammed Yar, an associate professor at COMSATS. \"This makes it an attractive candidate to explore further for treatment of hair loss in men.”




I'm guessing that since it's cheap and can't be patented as it's a naturally occurring  compound we'll never hear about it again.",2333,0.9313
t3_1ea3xxt,"Interesting.


You can get that sugar starting at 40euro per 5 gram.

And the study used a concentration of roughly 0.4% w/w.

If it's really as safe as they say, you could easily try it out at home.

The gels used had no difficult ingredients.
Just alginate, propylene glycol etc.",59,0.5542
t3_1ea3xxt,"From the article: In some good news for nearly half the world’s men, scientists have found that a naturally occurring sugar in humans and animals could be harnessed as a topical treatment for male pattern baldness. This discovery could deliver a non-invasive, inexpensive and safer alternative to leading treatment minoxidil.

An international team of scientists from the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University Pakistan has found that the organic compound 2-deoxy-D-ribose (2dDR) can stimulate new hair growth, following eight years of research into how this deoxy sugar could assist wound healing. The accidental discovery came about when they saw how hair around wound patches was showing accelerated growth, compared to non-treated areas. They believed it was having a direct impact on ailing hair follicles.

“Male pattern baldness is such a common condition, affecting men all over the world, but at the moment there are only two FDA licensed drugs to treat it,” said Sheila MacNeil, a professor at the University of Sheffield. “Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxy ribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth.”

To test their theory, the [researchers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1370833/full#h7) recreated testosterone-driven hair loss in mice, to mimic male pattern baldness in humans. They were then allocated groups: a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated negative control, a minoxidil-treated positive control, animals treated with 2dDR gel, and another given a gel made up of 2dDR and minoxidil.

Minoxidil, which is sold in topical form as brands Rogaine and Theroxidil, is one of only two FDA-approved hair-loss drugs currently on the market, and it does come with some side effects, such as sensitivity to light and scalp discomfort among the most common adverse reactions. It doesn’t treat receding hairlines, is more effective in people under the age of 40, and should not be used by anyone on blood-pressure medication.",151,0.9189

t3_1ea3hm3,Do you need to be relatively well-off to be able to afford a lot of fruit for children?,241,0.0
t3_1ea3hm3,"That's fascinating, 

  
The heading of the study suggests, \"Boosting fruit intake during midlife can ward off late-life blues\", while the topic states \"early in life\". This normally isn't a typo that I would bother paying attention to, but I think it should be noted as it can cause some misunderstanding. 

>\"The authors studied a total of 14 fruits most commonly consumed in Singapore and found that the consumption of most fruits, including oranges, tangerines, bananas, papayas, watermelons, apple and honey melon, was associated with reduced likelihood of depression. The association could possibly be the high levels of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory micronutrients in fruits—such as vitamin C, carotenoids and flavonoids—which have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inhibit inflammatory processes in the body that may affect the development of depression. Consumption of vegetables, on the other hand, was found to have no association with the likelihood of depressive symptoms

I find it a bit odd that it specifically discounted 'vegetables' when attempting to verify if these were nutrients that were specifically lacking in vegetables or not. Here is a guide to flavonoid availability of common vegetables from the USDA: [Microsoft PowerPoint - AICR03\\_VegFlavonoids.ppt (usda.gov)](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Articles/AICR03_VegFlav.pdf)

Concerning carotenoids, I know from memory that these are compounds commonly associated with the edible portion of plants that share a vibrant color. For vegetables this for example would be carrots, bell peppers, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, brocolli, spinach, and others. 

This being the case, could antioxidants and their anti-inflammatory components be the cause of this or is there another reason for fruit being the variable that matters?

Results

After a mean follow-up of 19.6 years, depressive symptoms were identified among 3,180 participants. Consumption of fruits was inversely associated with the odds of depressive symptoms in a dose-response manner: comparing extreme quartiles, the OR (95% CI) of depressive symptoms was 0.71 (0.63−0.81; P-trend <0.01). Intake of several types of fruits, especially orange, tangerine, banana, papaya and watermelon, was associated with reduced odds, and this inverse association was similar across subgroups of fruits categorized by glycemic index. Conversely, intake of vegetables was not associated with the odds of depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

Our findings support population-based recommendation of having sufficient fruit intake early in life to reduce the likelihood of depressive symptoms in late life.",6,-0.765

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14564

From the linked article: 

A recent study published in Psychophysiology sheds light on the relationship between anxiety and brain function, specifically focusing on how anxiety impacts the cognitive control network of the brain. The findings suggest that major anxiety disorders are associated with decreased activity in certain brain regions, which could serve as neural markers for anxiety symptoms.

Anxiety, characterized by irrational fear and feelings of helplessness, affects millions of people worldwide. While mild anxiety can be beneficial by making individuals more aware of their surroundings, severe anxiety can lead to debilitating conditions known as anxiety disorders. These disorders interfere with daily functioning and are often accompanied by other mental health issues, most commonly depression.

The findings suggest that decreased activity in these brain regions could be a neural marker for major anxiety disorders. The cognitive control network, including the rDLPFC and lFEF, is essential for regulating thoughts and emotions. Impaired function in this network could contribute to symptoms of anxiety, such as an inability to control unrealistic worries. These results align with previous studies that have linked anxiety to cognitive control impairments but provide more precise evidence by isolating anxiety from depression.

This study’s findings highlight the importance of targeting specific brain regions in treatments for anxiety disorders. By understanding the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety, researchers can develop more effective interventions. Future research should include more comprehensive measures of anxiety and depression, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale or the Beck Depression Inventory, to validate these findings.",30,-0.9764

t3_1e9s1zm,"Wouldn't that make sense as people with chronic forms of anxiety *aren't* regulated? Hence less activity in the area associated with regulation?  
  
Side note, this is not a dig at people with anxiety. As someone with a history of trauma, I'm quite familiar with just what it's like to lack that regulation and not even realize it, because *this* (broad gesturing) is all you might've ever known and you only start to realize it through improvement on your relationship toward your own emotions (especially the uncomfortable kind, they have a huge place to fill!). A lot of those skills come from having emotionally *safe*, supportive, mirroring, caring caregivers who support our inner experience and feelings rather than dismiss, minimize, invalidate or avoid them.  
Our culture doesn't help this at all by the way, in fact it actively encourages people to avoid feeling uncomfortable things.  
Extra side note, this isn't just a switch you flick on one day to change your relationship toward your emotions. It takes work and education about how emotions actually work, their role, regulation, improving the window of tolerance, processing, etc... Usually there's a lot of trauma to work through as we never learned how to process and resolve those things, and they're still floating around there in the background.  
Not saying there's a straightforward resolution to this as anxiety has a variety of valid sources and it can be more than just an unhealthy relationship toward emotion, but *we need more education about this side of it* rather than just medicating the *symptom* and wishing people luck.",5,0.8799

Previous research has linked loneliness to a range of health issues, including cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic conditions, as well as overall increased mortality. However, these associations do not account for all the health risks related to loneliness.

The concept of epigenetic aging, where biological age differs from chronological age due to molecular changes in DNA, is a promising area for understanding these risks. [In this study](https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000822), researchers Colin D. Freilich and colleagues investigated whether loneliness is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging and whether this, in turn, impacts chronic health conditions.

The researchers utilized data from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study, a comprehensive, longitudinal study that examines the role of psychological, social, and biological factors in aging. A total of 445 participants (between ages 26-86) who had completed longitudinal follow-ups were included in the analyses.

Loneliness was measured at the initial time point using three self-report items, with participants indicating how much of the time in the past 30 days they felt lonely, close to others, and like they belonged, on a 5-point scale. At two subsequent time points, participants reported any of 30 chronic health conditions they had experienced or been treated for in the past 12 months.",6,-0.7003

From the linked article: 

The sluggish start to the day, the struggle to concentrate on everyday tasks and the lethargy that comes with just a few hours sleep, these are the symptoms that will be familiar to anyone who suffers with insomnia.

But according to research, not all sleepless nights are the same. Brain scans have revealed evidence for distinct forms of insomnia, each with an associated pattern of neural wiring.

And while the clinical distinction may mean little to those whose days are blighted by sleep deprivation, the discovery does raise the prospect of tailored interventions for people with different kinds of insomnia, which could lead to better treatments.

Researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience in Amsterdam analysed MRI scans from more than 200 insomniacs and dozens of sound sleepers and spotted structural changes that distinguished sleepers from the sleepless and five separate forms of insomnia.

“If these subtypes differ in their biological mechanism, then patients in each subtype might benefit from different focused treatments,” said Tom Bresser, a neuroscientist and first author on the study.

In the latest work, published in Biological Psychiatry and led by Prof Eus van Someren, the team looked at MRI brain scans from 204 people with insomnia who had been grouped according to the subtypes. The scans revealed brain structure differences between the subtypes, providing further evidence that they are rooted in biology.",31,0.7876

We mined two years’ worth of data from the National Household Pulse Survey and analyzed 21 survey waves, each with more than 60,000 respondents. We were able to trace how newly introduced gestational restrictions and abortion bans affected mental health outcomes such as anxiety, worry, disinterest and depression on a state-by-state basis. The increase in self-reported mental health issues amounts to an approximate 3% relative rise over the pre-Dobbs baseline of 18% to 26% – a troubling increase by any measure.

Why it matters
Two years after the Dobbs decision, the country is still coming to grips with its societal repercussions. Some states have tightened restrictions on abortion, while others have taken measures to preserve access, leading thousands of women to travel across state lines each month to obtain these services. As of July 2024, 21 states have passed abortion bans or enacted more restrictive gestational limits.

t3_1e9fk9p,">While no level of forest degradation through logging was too low to have an impact on the ecosystem, the results showed that forests that had lost less than 29% of ‘biomass’ (total weight of organic matter) retained relatively high biodiversity and ecological value, and, if left alone, are likely to recover.



>Above 68% biomass removal, however, many types of plants and animals formed communities that were effectively ‘scrambled’ by extinctions and invasive species. In these areas, intensive proactive conservation efforts would be needed to restore biodiversity. Beyond this, the forests rapidly lost the ability to sustain themselves – to act as complete, functioning ecosystems.",1,-0.1531

t3_1e9f6hh,Wouldn't autistic mothers be more likely to have an unhealthy diet due to sensory issues?,907,-0.5267
t3_1e9f6hh,"According to the study, a healthy prenatal dietary pattern includes high intakes of fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and whole grains, and low intakes of red and processed meats, soft drinks, and foods high in fats and refined carbohydrates.

>The pattern was denoted healthy as food items with high factor scores represent foods that are encouraged according to dietary guidelines worldwide and nationally.29,30 The dietary patterns generally loaded highly for fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and whole grain foods and had low factor loadings for red and processed meats, soft drinks, and foods high in fats and/or refined carbohydrates. Additionally, nutrient intakes across the levels of adherence to HPDP (eTable 3 in Supplement 1) were broadly consistent with each country’s respective national nutritional recommendations",131,0.4404

t3_1e9f6hh,"I’m so curious about fats. They are supposedly good for hormones and also they make it more likely to have twins (more resources to go around?) and here we see it linked to autism in a negative way. 

Everything else in general pregnancy diet recommendations seems to make sense in keeping inflammation low and providing plenty of nutrients but I’m really fascinated about research regarding fats.",123,0.6636
t3_1e9f6hh,"This study in mice [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467420/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467420/)  looked at  *high-fat (HFD), high-carbohydrate, and mixed diets on molecular changes in adolescent and young adult offspring frontal cortex and hippocampus. Our results showed that maternal HFD significantly altered the expression of 48 ASD-related genes in the frontal cortex of male offspring.* 

And not only the pregnancy stage, but the lactation stage as well *Taken together, it was concluded that a maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation periods can lead to abnormal brain development within the transcription and translation of ASD-related genes mainly in male offspring.*

Most studies look at high fat and high carbs combined, so it is interesting that they tested the three options: high fat, high carbs and mixed. High fat came out as the worst. 

In the genetic syndrome I have, NF1, a maternal  obesogenic diet is also linked to an increased risk in one of our manifestation, an optic pathway glioma. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39023130/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39023130/)",19,-0.0141

I went through fertility treatments and was eating extremely healthy for literal years before I become pregnant and then I doubled down on it after pregnancy. My child is autistic. The only person I know who was bigger on this than me also has a child with an autism diagnosis. I’m all for trying to eat healthy, but this just seems like it’s trying to blame moms again (there is a history of blaming moms of autistic children for the socialization (and other) differences of their children, starting from the “Refrigerator Mom” nonsense.

Edit: I will note that I vomited a lot during pregnancy. I had tricks so that I could hold food down without vomiting close to bed time and nap time because both happened while I was pregnant. More support and help for those who vomit a lot during pregnancy would be a helpful thing. I talked about it with all the doctors and nurses and was continually dismissed (because I gained weight at the optimal rate, I guess).",16,0.9494

t3_1e9f6hh,"I really hate all these studies that focus on eugenics for autistics, instead of putting the majority of funding into understanding autism and  making supports. 

Less than 10% (and sometimes less than 1%) of all funding for autism goes towards eugenics type research like this. It paints autism as a disease whoch is so harmful. 

For people who are level 3, their caregivers can be burnt out and stressed. So why not make supports for them and make a more inclusive world that can help make the bad symptoms far more manageable?

If you have a broken leg and gotta carry someone up 10 flights of stairs, maybe look into an elevator instead of how to build a gun to get rid of them. As a level 2 autistic, I really hate the anti-autistic eugenics movement.",6,-0.8803
t3_1e9f6hh,"I wonder about the volume of self-reporting fallacy here. One person is more relaxed and genuinely forgets to mention every other hot dog. Or \"beautifies\" her diet and kid's social skills. Other meticulously records every sip of milk shake due to plain anxiety and then drastically exaggerates her kid's communication problems. 

Plus it's just about correlation, nothing about causation. A diet will depend on the income factor, place of living and thus there will be a significant environmental factor. And nationality (i.e. traditional food in the household), other genetics (predisposition to autism) will also play a role.",3,0.2484
